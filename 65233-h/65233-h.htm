<p class="p2">“Some poet has observed that if any man would
write down what has really happened to him in this
mortal life he would be sure to make a good book,
though he never had met with a single adventure
from his birth to his burial.” Even Thackeray does
not take the responsibility for the thesis, but with
a light heart lays the burden upon the shoulders of
“some poet.” And for my part I had never any
intention of answering the poet’s challenge until
after a quarter of a century of life in Manchester I
found myself back again in my original domicile.
I doubt if I had ever really acquired a domicile in
Manchester. There was residence, but was there
<!--Page 010--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
intention? I think I must decide that somewhere
at the back of my mind there was an intention if not
a desire to return.</p>

<p>But when I did return, how many changes I found.
Of course I had paid fleeting visits to London during
the term of my exile; but here I was again for better
or worse, and my mind made contrast of to-day with
the memories of twenty-five years ago. Where were
the familiar faces? Not all were gone certainly, but
those that remained seemed to my eyes duller,
grizzled and less alert than I had remembered them.
And no doubt I was the same to them, and had grown
rugged and provincial during my long absence. For
when old friends met me in the Strand or the Temple
they patted my shoulder in a kindly compassionate
manner as if I were a pit pony who had just come to
the surface after several decades of darkness. These
Londoners who knew nothing of Manchester and the
North seemed to fancy I was blinking and dazzled
with the brilliancy of their converse, when in truth
and in fact I was wondering why they all&mdash;&#8203;except
the Jews&mdash;&#8203;spoke with a tinge of Cockney accent.
When they congratulated me upon my “promotion,”
as they called it, I could not help contrasting
the trial of cases arising out of commercial contracts
on the Manchester Exchange with the trespass of
sheep among the turnip-tops, which is the nearest
we have to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</i> in the Weald of Kent.</p>

<p>But what caused me a greater sinking of heart was
that, when I spoke of Manchester men and Manchester
affairs, I spoke to deaf ears. Your Peckham
<!--Page 011--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
and Surbiton Londoner knows indeed that there is
such a place as Manchester on the map, but intellectually
and spiritually he is far nearer to New York
or Johannesburg. The works and doings of these
places interest and amuse him, but the annals of the
great cities of the North are closed books to him.
And when I was lamenting on such a state of things
I came across Thackeray’s message and wondered
if it was intended for me. I could not help thinking
how many of us would like to have the reminiscences
of the pit pony. How entertaining it would be to
his fellow ponies below to know what the old fellow
really thought of them, and how the story of a life
underground would tickle the supercilious ears of
the pony aristocrats who had spent their lives
among surburban milk floats and butchers’ carts, or
even let us say in the polo field. There was the
personal pleasure, too, of remembering and setting
down the story of the days that were gone and
describing the highways and byways along which I
had travelled so pleasantly, and the thought that
some who were children in those years might like
to know what sort of a world it was they used to
live in.</p>

<p>Maybe Charles Lamb is right when he asks himself
“Why do cats grin in Cheshire?” and tells us
that “it was once a County Palatine, and the cats
cannot help laughing when they think of it.” For
my part as one who has been a “poore Palatine” in
the adjacent county of Lancaster I confess that the
very sound of its name will always induce a smile&mdash;&#8203;or
<!--Page 012--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
should I say a purr&mdash;&#8203;at the pleasant memories
with which it is fragrant.</p>

<p>Attachment to places is quite irrespective of their
pleasances. The fields and orchards of Kent, white
with blossom in the spring, purple and golden with
the heavy fruits of autumn, can never be as acceptable
to me as the mud building land of South
Manchester. The Embankment and the Strand&mdash;&#8203;even
in its debased modern form&mdash;&#8203;and the Temple
Gardens and the fountain will always be home to
one who started life as a Londoner, and was educated
in the cellars of Somerset House. But in solitary
thoughts and dreams I shall glide in fancy down the
flags of Oxford Road, and watch the rooks building
on Fallowfield “Broo,” or strike across the fields of
Chorlton’s Farm by the cottages with the old vine
on them, and take the train from Alexandra Park to
my work. When I come out of the Lambeth County
Court into the Camberwell New Road it will always
feel irksome to me not to be able to stride up Peter
Street and push open the swing doors of a certain
club in Mosley Street and find myself in an atmosphere
of tobacco and good fellowship. You get so
attached to the actual place in which you dwell that
though things are better and more beautiful elsewhere
your optic nerves do not respond at their call,
or you suffer from a geographical deafness. I do
not defend such narrow patriotism, I only assert
that it exists. The other day I found myself in a fog
in London&mdash;&#8203;one which Mr. Guppy would call a <em>real</em>
London particular&mdash;&#8203;saying to a friend, “Call this a
<!--Page 013--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
fog? You should see a first-class Manchester fog.”
I knew I was a boaster and a braggart, for Manchester
fogs, though tastier in chemical flavour, have
not the real woolly orange blanket appearance of the
fog that rolls up white from the Nore and bronzes
with the London smoke.</p>

<p>I think I have the place attachment&mdash;&#8203;a limpet-like
characteristic, after all&mdash;&#8203;very highly developed.
I remember a story of a little boy, about three years
old or perhaps more, who moved with his family and
their furniture into a new house. At first the affair
excited him, but later on he wandered uneasily and
miserably about his new quarters with an idea that
he would never smile again, and that the sooner the
world came to an end the better for everybody.
Poor, doleful, little urchin, he climbed up long flights
of stairs into a box-room, and there, finding a pile of
old carpets, he selected one that had belonged to his
nursery and laid him down to die. Forgotten in the
turmoil, he cried himself to sleep, and was discovered
by anxious domestics after prolonged search. I
know a great deal of the story is true, because I have
heard it from some of my more reliable relations, and
as the hero of the story I believe I can remember
hearing an agonised nurse calling my name in despair,
and sullenly refusing to reply to her calls on the
ground that I never wished to consort with the world
again since I had discovered with Zarathustra that
“all is empty, all is equal, all hath been.”</p>

<p>This attachment to places is a very animal virtue,
or failing, whichever it be, and in my experience is
<!--Page 014--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
not so much a home-sickness as a nausea of novelty.
One erects in one’s mind a standard of what ought to
be, and applies that to the beloved place; and by
constantly asserting to strangers that the place is in
all particulars absolutely perfect, one begins by mere
force of the repetition to believe in it oneself. In
this way do myths become religions. There are
many Manchester myths, all of which in my
patriotism&mdash;&#8203;the more vehement because I cannot
claim birthright in the great city&mdash;&#8203;I repeat, and shall
continue to repeat, with the accuracy and fervour
with which I still run over on occasion my “duty to
my neighbour.” Thus a true Manchester man will
tell you Manchester is musical, whereas, in truth and
in fact, very few of her people care anything about
music at all. Also he will speak with glowing pride
of the marvellous municipal statesmanship of her
governors, whereas, though we are very fond of them
personally, we know they are about as ordinary a set
of parish councillors as ever met in a village schoolroom.
I myself have often reproved a mere
Southerner for casting aspersions on our climate by
saying “it was not half so black as it is painted,”
when I knew that on oath I should have to admit
that no ink could paint it black enough. These
are lawful perjuries, and unworthy of Manchester
would any citizen be who should hesitate to repeat
them.</p>

<p>And yet I am not altogether sorry that I left
Manchester. It is true that it was for purely
personal and domestic reasons that I came south.
<!--Page 015--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
There was no financial gain in my move, and
therefore there is no ecclesiastical precedent for
pretending that I had received a spiritual call to
a wider sphere of action. At the same time it
is possible that the dignity and decorum of
Lambeth may be perfected by that “wakkening
up” spirit which the apostles of Manchester go forth
to maintain.</p>

<p>I remember when I was moving south, Bishop
Welldon asking me on the steps of the pavilion at
Old Trafford, “And where is your diocese?”</p>

<p>“Lambeth,” I replied promptly. “It sounds
ecclesiastical, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It did until your name was connected with it,”
said the Bishop with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>And I left him wondering whether that was the
reason Providence had translated me to the Camberwell
New Road.</p>

<p>As for myself, I never want my name to be
connected with Lambeth; but in so far as it will
ever be remembered at all, I pray that it may find
its way into some niche in those cyclopædias and
other mausoleums of the famous under the title
“Manchester.”</p>

<p>And I am not alone in thinking that “Farewell
Manchester” is a sad phrase to utter. For when
Charles Edward left Manchester in 1745 after those
pleasant weeks of revelry among the gentry of
Lancashire and Cheshire, the legend is that he rode
sadly over the Derbyshire hills chanting that mournful
lament the music of which the old prebendary
<!--Page 016--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
of Hereford set down in later years and called
“Felton’s Gavot” or “Farewell Manchester.” But
I picture the Pretender cantering along and rallying
his friends about the Lancashire lasses, whose hearts
they had conquered and whose ribbons they wore
in their bonnets, and I believe it was only in after
years that the mournful ballad spread round the
countryside and the ballad-mongers sang of the
young prince whose “tear-drops bodingly from their
prisons start.”</p>

<p>It would be absurd for modern visitors to Manchester,
rushing away from the city in a luxurious dining
car, plunging beneath the Disley Golf Links and
emerging among the picturesque Derbyshire crags,
to throw themselves into the romantic humour of the
heroes of ’45 and mingle tear-drops with their soup.
But alone with your thoughts, if you have lived in
the midst of Manchester and her people and experienced
their gracious hospitality to the stranger
that is within their gates, you may find yourself
crooning old Felton’s Gavot, and learn that the song
vibrates in a minor key and that the tear-drops can
only be kept back by control.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing to say “Farewell!” in the
right key. Many, many kindly letters I received
when I went away, and all were full of gracious
messages; but the one I best remember as saying the
just word of complimentary reproof was a valedictory
letter from the Secretary of the Crematorium,
in which he wrote, “our committee feel very grieved
that you should be leaving us in this manner.” I
<!--Page 017--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
quote from memory, and of course the wording may
not be exactly accurate. But the idea was beautifully
and delicately expressed, and to the hidden
indictment in the letter I plead guilty and throw
myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

<p class="p2">I do not want to anger my readers at the
threshold with heraldic learning of the couching lions
and ramping cats to which the Parrys of Nerquis
are by right entitled, but I claim a Welshman’s
privilege of setting down so much of genealogy
as is necessary to the understanding of my story.
And truly one of the temptations that lured me to
this task was a desire to write down what I could
remember of my father, John Humffreys Parry&mdash;&#8203;Serjeant
Parry&mdash;&#8203;who died more than thirty years
ago, and left so fine a memory among his comrades
in the battles of old in Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>And I often heard my father talk of his Welsh
ancestry, though he himself was a Londoner born in
1816, and he would tell us what he remembered of
his father, John Humffreys Parry, the Welsh antiquary
and writer who was called to the Bar in 1811,
<!--Page 019--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
and died when my father was a boy of sixteen. He
was the writer of the “Cambrian Plutarch” and
editor of the “Cambro Briton,” a journal of Celtic
folk-lore and the ancient literature and history of
Wales. Nowadays he would probably have been a
professor at a Welsh University, but in those days
people cared for none of these things. I remember
reading in some Welsh account of his career&mdash;&#8203;and
among Welshmen he is far better known than my
father&mdash;&#8203;how he was educated at Mold Grammar
School and articled to Mr. Wynne, solicitor, of that
town, and married a daughter of John Thomas,
solicitor, of Llanfyllin, which is away down in the
wilds of Montgomeryshire. This biographer wound
up his story with the compendious statement that
“he went to London, was called to the Bar, took to
literature and dissipated his estates.” But if he had
any estates, which is at least doubtful, he wasted
them not in riotous living, but in the printing and
publishing of the Welsh literature he loved. From
the earliest he was an eager and ready writer. I
have a small brown scrapbook, the leaves of which
are saffron-tinged with age, in which are pasted with
proud care the author’s letters and verses contributed
to the <cite>Chester Courant</cite> in the early part of
the century, when he was a youth in Mr. Wynne’s
office in Mold.</p>

<p>Some years ago curiosity led me into the land of
my forefathers, and I climbed the steep hill between
Mold and Ruthin to reach Llanferres, going past
“The Three Loggerheads,” the sign of which
<!--Page 020--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
Richard Wilson, R.A., the landscape painter, is
reputed to have painted. It is the old jest of two
heads grinning at you&mdash;&#8203;the third you supply for
yourself. And if Wilson painted it, as they say he
did, it was probably done in his early days, for he
came from Mold, and as he died in 1782 the sign must
have been there in my great-grandfather Edward
Parry’s time, when he became rector of the little
hill village of Llanferres in 1790. And doubtless
he often saw it as he walked down the hill to visit
his wife’s relatives in Mold, or went across to Nerquis
to see his father Edward Parry, the tanner.</p>

<p>And at Llanferres I searched the church registers,
and finding that the rector was carried home to his
native village of Nerquis, I turned my steps along the
narrow roads down the side of the hill where his
funeral must have passed and found a little village
church at the foot-hills on the English side, so much
away from the bustle of the world’s traffic that I
think it must be much the same to-day as it was when
my great-grandfather was carried back to his early
home. And when the little churchyard of Nerquis
gives up its collection of Parrys it will relinquish a
goodly number who lived and died in this quiet,
solitary place, and from what one reads on marble
slabs and the like, they were a godly, honest and
well-doing people. But to my regret I find that
Edward the tanner’s father was the Rev. Canon
Edward Parry, M.A., Vicar of Oswestry in 1763,
and his father was Thomas, an attorney of Welshpool
who lived near the bridge, so that as we reach the
<!--Page 021--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
seventeenth century it dawns upon me that I do not
belong to North Wales at all, and I cease my
researches into the past, in dread that I should
discover after all that I am no better than a South
Wales man, a “Hwntw” in good northern speech,
or “man from beyond.”</p>

<p>My very earliest personal recollection of my father
was in the days of my childhood, when we lived at
No. 1, Upper Gloucester Place, overlooking Dorset
Square. In the interests of the committee of the
society that busies itself placing decorative lozenges
on the birth-places of the famous it is well to record
that I have it on hearsay evidence that this is where
I was born.</p>

<p>I can well remember, and as it were visualise, my
father in that house, but only on one day of the
week&mdash;&#8203;the Sunday. On other days I cannot
remember to have seen him at all. But I can recall
many details of the house itself, and well remember
that the library window looked on to New Street, in
which lived our chemist and druggist; and of an
evening I would go into the library and climb on a
chair to enjoy the glory of his huge coloured bottles
in the window, and then meanly pull faces at the
nauseous shop in revenge for the wrongs I had
suffered at its hands.</p>

<p>My brother and I took our morning walks in
Dorset Square. In the early sixties Dorset Square
was a vast jungle. Speaking from memory, it contained
well-accredited lions and bears in its fastnesses.
I saw Dorset Square the other day. It has sadly
<!--Page 022--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
shrunk. Those giant shrubs that towered over your
head, hiding you securely from a distracted nurse, are
no longer there. Regent’s Park was my other playground
or, rather, that part of it opposite Sussex
Terrace called “The Enclosure,” to which we had a
right of entrance and a key. I do not know that it
is a matter of importance now, but it was of the
essence of happiness in those days that our good
nurse <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex abundanti cautela</i> carried the key of “The
Enclosure” in one hand, and my brother and I contested
for her other hand, as a prize of great worth.
Regent’s Park retains more of its size than Dorset
Square, but it is not the illimitable veldt that it was.
“The Enclosure” was snobbish, and its snobbery has
been very properly curtailed. I well remember how
we envied the nurseless urchins in their freedom of
the real park across the water. It was on that
treacherous lake some forty people were drowned in
a terrible ice accident. I remember being hurried
out of “The Enclosure” past the tent into which they
were carrying the drowned. For many months
afterwards there was the draining, levelling, and then
the refilling of the lake. All this work I superintended
from the banks, and at last watched the
water come bubbling up from a huge pipe into the
new-made lake with as deep a satisfaction as the
chief engineer himself.</p>

<p>But in all these childhood’s scenes I do not recall
that my father had any part. He was, of course, at
this time a very hard-worked man, but Sunday
morning he always devoted to his children. I can
<!--Page 023--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
picture his solid, kindly face and see his commanding
figure wrapped in a dressing-gown of many colours&mdash;&#8203;an
old friend&mdash;&#8203;as he sat at the end of the breakfast-table
when we were brought down from the nursery.
The only other member of the party was Tiger, a
favourite tabby cat of whom my father was very
proud. He had a great love of cats, and at one time
possessed three, which he named Hic, Hæc, and Hoc.
The appositeness of the names came to me with the
Latin grammar and years of discretion. Two
journals were his Sabbath reading&mdash;<cite>The Spectator</cite>
and <cite>Athenæum</cite>, but he laid down his paper when
we arrived, and took that real interest in our affairs
which is the only key to children’s hearts. One
great task was the skilful arrangement of all the
animals of Noah’s Ark on the breakfast-table, which
was rewarded with buttered toast. In a spirit of fairness
Tiger was requested to walk among the animals.
This if he did without mishap earned him the guerdon
of cream. Then there was a careful examination
on our weekly studies of the pages of <cite>Punch</cite>,
which my father held rightly to be the earliest
nursery text-book of history and sociology for the
English child. This was followed by dramatic
recitals of Mr. Southey’s “Three Bears” and some
of Jane and Ann Taylor’s original poems, and other
childhood’s sagas. And then when the nurse’s
fateful knock was heard at the door to take the
young gentlemen for a walk, off went my father’s
huge dressing-gown, two wildly excited urchins
sprang into the limitless depths of the arm-chair and
<!--Page 024--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
were covered up by the garment, and my father with
dramatic breathlessness shouted “Come in!” and
was “discovered”&mdash;&#8203;to use a phrase of the theatre&mdash;&#8203;calmly
reading the paper at the table. The same
dialogue was always maintained. The nurse inquired
where the children were; the father expressed his
astonishment at their disappearance; Tiger was
asked if he had seen them, and remained silent.
Then an elaborate search with hopeless ejaculations of
the searchers was received with ill-concealed shrieks
of amusement by the hiders. At last they are discovered,
and the curtain falls on the most glorious
hour in the whole week. For just as men and women
love the old plays and the old ideas of drama, so
children will have the same game of hide-and-seek or
what not, and play it in the same way with the same
absurd ritual religiously carried out, and he alone is
worthy of fatherhood who can take an honourable part
in such affairs with real solemnity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But these baby days departed, and the Sunday
mornings had to be passed in Christ Church, Marylebone,
surely the most unsociable church I have ever
entered. I used to shudder for fear that after all
heaven might turn out to be something like Christ
Church, Marylebone. It still haunts me in dyspeptic
dreams. It was a huge classical building, as cheerful
as a family vault, with one painting over the altar&mdash;&#8203;how
many hours have I spent gazing at it&mdash;&#8203;and no
other memorable decoration. The congregation
were penned apart in high boxes. Our box had
tall red hassocks. I used to be allowed to stand on
<!--Page 025--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
one of these, until I fell off it into the bottom of the
pen audibly and demonstratively. After that I
was consigned to the floor, from which you could
not see even bonnets, and from this limbo I only
emerged by gradual growth. The preacher wore
a black gown. My earliest meeting with him must,
I think, have been at the font. I remember his
grave tones, clear voice and dignified presence. I
know now he must have preached excellent sermons,
for he was the Rev. Llewelyn Davies. But in those
days my brother and I fully believed he was the
anonymous “righteous man” in the Psalms whose
doings and sayings are so carefully chronicled.</p>

<p>From Regent’s Park we moved away to Kensington,
and thence to Holland Park. Here it was that
in the seventies, during the last few years of my
father’s life, I heard in snatches from himself and
his older friends something of the story of his career.
I was then at King’s College School, which at that
time was situated below Somerset House, and as
I travelled up and down in the Underground&mdash;&#8203;often
with my father&mdash;&#8203;and did my home-lessons in
his library and dined with him nearly every night,
and often went to the play with him of an evening,
I had the good fortune to see more of him than I
should have done had I been away at school.</p>

<p>He must have had a keen struggle in his early
days to reach the position he did at the Bar. Born
in London in 1816, he was only sixteen years old
when the sudden death of his father made it necessary
for him to earn his own living. He was then
<!--Page 026--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
being educated at the Philological School, an old
foundation in Marylebone, but he left school at
once and went into a merchant’s office. Edwin
Abbott, the head-master of the Philological School,
continued his firm friend, and years afterwards
his daughter Elizabeth married my father, who was
then a Serjeant. But I do not propose to write
of my mother in these pages, since I could not do
justice to the grace of her memory, and the dim
vision of it is my own affair.</p>

<p>The Abbotts were, as I understand, an old family
of yeomen and farmers in Dorsetshire. I have seen
a pamphlet concerning the great George Abbott,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who bravely withstood
James I. in the matter of the Essex divorce, showing
that he was of the same family. I hope it may be so.
My father used to laugh at genealogy, but for my
part I rather like to speculate on pedigrees and
family history. It is pleasant to trace one’s line
back to tanners and farmers and attorneys, even with
a dash of the Church thrown in. The ancestry of
the horse and the greyhound is a study for every
gambler on the course, and why should not a student
of eugenics be interested in the evolution of the
entries for the human race?</p>

<p>Whilst he was in a merchant’s office my father
attended classes at the Aldersgate Institution, a
valuable educational society promoted by Lord
Brougham, and he became a constant attendant at
a debating club held there. He was a great believer
in orderly debate as a method of education,
<!--Page 027--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
and was always ready to discuss with me the subject
of debate in my School Society. The art of speaking
he thought should be equally a part of elementary
education with reading and writing, and his view
was that if such were the case the charlatan and the
windbag would have less chance of capturing the ear
of the public.</p>

<p>From the merchant’s stool he found his way to
the British Museum, where he was an assistant for
some years, and formed a lasting friendship with
Anthony Panizzi, who was then keeper of the
printed books. I remember Richard Garnett showing
me one of the slips in the catalogue in my
father’s handwriting in the days before that great
work was printed. All this time he was reading
for the Bar and taking an active interest in the
political movements of the day. George Jacob
Holyoake remembers him as a young law-student
at No. 5, Gray’s Inn Road. He describes him as a
stalwart, energetic platform speaker, and notes that
he ultimately acquired two styles like O’Connell,
the more gaseous of which he retained solely to
illuminate electors.</p>

<p>In 1842, the year before he was called, he was one
of the most active members of the Moral Force
Chartists. Hanging on my walls in a dark, old-fashioned
veneered frame is a large print in many
colours of the famous Charter&mdash;&#8203;a harmless exploded
torpedo nowadays no doubt&mdash;&#8203;but in 1842 the symbol
of a grave reality. For Chartism, as Carlyle
pointed out, was “the bitter discontent grown
<!--Page 028--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
fierce and mad, the wrong condition therefore, or
the wrong disposition of the Working Classes of
England.” With the ring of the true prophet in
his words he foresaw in 1842 that Chartism “did
not begin yesterday; will by no means end this
day or to-morrow … new and ever new embodiments,
chimeras madder or less mad have to
continue.”</p>

<p>My father’s part at this time was the editing of a
magazine called the <cite>National Associations Gazette</cite>.
The problem it set itself out to deal with was why
when all kinds of property were recognised and
protected the property which a man has in his
labour was to be unsupported and unrepresented.
The political programme, in the “order of going in,”
so to speak, was (1) the Charter; (2) Universal
Suffrage of men and women; and (3) National
Education. I have often heard my father in argument
with other reformers laying down&mdash;&#8203;too dogmatically
as I thought&mdash;&#8203;that National Education
before Suffrage was the cart before the horse. If
you educate masses to think and deny them
the power of practically endeavouring to translate
their thought into national action it is bound to
break out into anti-national actions. Who shall
say in regard to recent events in England and
India that there was not much good sense in his
reasoning.</p>

<p>From my very earliest childhood I seem to have
heard of Chartists and Chartism and the “Condition
of England,” question which, after all, remains with
<!--Page 029--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
us to-day turbulently unanswered. Very often of a
Sunday afternoon we would drive over to some
obscure lodgings in Paddington to see Mr. William
Lovett. I remember him as a mild, amiable, white-haired
old gentleman who had a wonderful facility for
making models, and whilst he and my father talked
of the old days of the National Complete Suffrage
Union and Birmingham meetings, I used to inspect
with ardent curiosity some ingenious model of
Windsor Castle upon which Mr. Lovett was at work.
I think my father and some others assisted
Mr. Lovett, and I know that he had a great admiration
and affection for him, which continued until
his death in 1877. I stood in great awe of Mr. Lovett,
for I knew that he had been heavily fined for refusing
to serve in the Militia in days long ago, and had
suffered imprisonment in Warwick gaol for his
protest against the unconstitutional employment of
the Metropolitan police in Birmingham. This frail,
delicate old man, with the cunning fingers building
quaint models in a back parlour in Paddington, the
sweetest and friendliest of human beings, had been,
in the eyes of the government, a revolutionist. I was
always ready to go with my father to see him. I
liked the mystery of him.</p>

<p>The energy my father displayed in his early years
at the Bar must have been considerable. He was
much in demand as a lecturer, and as he told me, for
a year or two his main source of income was the
delivery throughout England of his lectures on the
Oratory of the Bar, the Pulpit and the Stage, and
<!--Page 030--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
another interesting series on the French Revolution,
a subject in which he was deeply read.</p>

<p>I came across a gentleman in Manchester who well
remembered his lecturing at the Athenæum in 1844,
and gave him great praise for his dramatic recitals on
the Oratory of the Stage. But his practice at the Bar
must soon have made lecturing tours unnecessary
and impossible. When he was called he said in fun
to some friends he was entertaining, that as soon as
he was earning a thousand a year he would give them
all a far better feast. The banquet took place within
four years of the invitation.</p>

<p>His interest in politics never diminished. But
when he had made his great name as an advocate,
all invitations to contest a seat in Parliament
were refused. In 1847 he contested Norwich
unsuccessfully against Lord Douro and Sir Samuel
Peto, and in 1857 stood for Finsbury against
Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, who was returned
by a large majority. In this election he used
to say his chances were seriously interfered with
by a charge&mdash;&#8203;not true, in fact&mdash;&#8203;that he had
signed a petition to open the Crystal Palace and
British Museum on Sunday. As he explained, the
only reason he had not signed such a petition was
that he had never been asked.</p>

<p>I have often heard my father speaking in Court,
but it was at a time when I could understand very
little of the merits of the dispute or the quality of
the advocacy. He was one of the leaders of the
Home Circuit, a veritable nest of giants, with Bovill,
<!--Page 031--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
Ballantine, Hawkins, Lush and Shee. In those
days the Home Circuit was a reality. It was before
the abolition of local venue, and every case had to be
set down in the assize town of the county in which
it arose. Thus at Guildford, Kingston or Croydon,
all Surrey cases had to be tried, and the lists took a
fortnight or more to finish. My father sometimes
took a furnished house at Guildford in the summer,
and we all moved down there, and on occasion I
was taken into Court to hear him speak. In later
years I heard him in several cases, but in no speech
of first-rate importance, and I never heard him
defend a prisoner, at which, I have been told by
good judges, he had few equals. I should say his
great asset as an advocate was his honesty and
openness. There is no such thing as first-rate
advocacy without a large measure of frankness.
He was very smooth and good-natured in cross-examination,
recognising that to make your way
through the defences of the enemy requires, if the
enemy is alert, more strategy than force. He never
indulged in those snappy interjections and quarrelsome
interferences which are but too common, and
which, to my mind, are the very badge and stamp of
incompetent advocacy. I fancy to-day his speeches
to the jury would be too ornate, too eloquent and too
full of oratory, but in his own day, and among the
juries he had to address, it was more true of him than
of any other that “persuasion hung upon his lips.”
Nor can I be very clear that his style was really too
flamboyant, for I was brought up myself in the school
<!--Page 032--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
of Russell and Holker on the Northern Circuit, where
there was a passion for business methods, and curt
address and the use of the bludgeon, rather than the
rapier, in cross-examination, which has not even to
this day penetrated to the more leisurely south.
For I find that even in southern county courts
advocates are known not only to demand the
presence of juries, but to address them with great
complacency on any subject at any distance from
that subject. County court juries are nearly
unknown in the North, where a trial is regarded more
as a matter of business than an affair of display.</p>

<p>When my late brother Judge Willis, K.C., was a
junior he was a constant visitor at my father’s
house at Holland Park, and I well remember him
telling a capital story of Holker’s wit as an advocate.
Holker was cross-examining a big, vulgar Jew
jeweller in a money-lending case, and began by
looking him up and down in a sleepy, dismal way,
and drawled out, “Well, Mr. Moselwein, and what
are you?”</p>

<p>“A genschelman,” replied the jeweller with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Just so, just so,” ejaculated Holker with a
dreary yawn, “but what were you, Mr. Moselwein,
before you were a gentleman?”</p>

<p>The answer was drowned in a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“Capital story, Willis, and very clever,” said my
father as he finished laughing, “always supposing
Holker didn’t want to get any admissions out of the
fellow afterwards.”</p>

<p><!--Page 033--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
It is a pleasant and fairly easy thing for an
advocate to score off a witness, but it does not always
mean business, and nothing is nearer to the gospel of
the matter than this, that every unnecessary question
in cross-examination is a blunder and every question
the answer to which you have not foreseen is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Affairs of conscience at the Bar and the duty of
the advocate were often discussed between my
father and his legal friends, and in the late seventies,
when I was at King’s College School, I heard many
interesting conversations on these themes.</p>

<p>As an illustration of his argument someone told a
story of an old special pleader whose name I forget.
Special pleaders, I may remind the reader, did not
address the Court, but drafted the “pleadings,”
as they are called&mdash;&#8203;that is to say, the documents
in which the parties state their respective cases
and endeavour to settle the issue. In the old days
these pleas were very technical, and special pleaders
who signed and settled the claim, defence, rejoinder,
sur-rejoinder, rebutter and sur-rebutter made good
incomes out of constant but small fees.</p>

<p>The Pleader was in his chambers in King’s Bench
Walk, when late one night a young Hebrew clerk
of a firm of City solicitors rushed in, and throwing
down half a guinea and some papers said, “I vant
a plea.”</p>

<p>“But what sort of a plea&mdash;&#8203;what is the defence?”
asked the Pleader.</p>

<p>“There is no defence,” said the candid clerk, “but
<!--Page 034--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
the governor says he vould like a set-off. He vants
to gain time.”</p>

<p>“Hm!” said the Pleader, “a merely dilatory plea
to gain time. I don’t approve of such a thing; but
still----”</p>

<p>He drew out his “Bullen and Leake” and copied
out the first plea he came to, which was to the
effect that by agreement made by and between the
plaintiff and defendant, the defendant bargained
and sold to the plaintiff certain Russian hemp, to
arrive by and be delivered by the ship <span class="title">Sarcophagus</span>,
at the price of £15 per ton, and after further formalities
the defendant sought to set-off the price of this
Russian hemp against the plaintiff’s claim. This
he handed to the boy, who took it away.</p>

<p>A year afterwards the same lad returned with
another set of defenceless papers and another half-guinea,
and asked for a similar plea to be drawn.
The Pleader looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What became of that last case?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ve proved your plea! Ve proved it!” cried
the young clerk in triumph. “It vos magnificent!
Ve vant another. Ve cannot prove the same plea
twice.”</p>

<p>The moral verdict seemed to go against the special
pleader, who had not, it appeared, been properly
instructed in the Russian hemp affair, and it led my
father to a curious story of a case in which he had
recently appeared in an inquiry <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de lunatico</i>. I had
driven down with him one Saturday some time
before to Dr. Tuke’s private asylum, where he went
<!--Page 035--><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
to interview his client. The gentleman had great
wealth and was very eccentric, and had recently
announced in public that he was our Saviour.
He was certified as a lunatic and had demanded an
inquiry. When we arrived at the house he was
playing a game of billiards with his coat off, but he
shook hands very amicably with my father and put
his coat on, and he and the solicitor went along for
a conference whilst I had a hundred up with a young
doctor. I had never seen anyone who was supposed
to be insane before and could not understand, how
such a thing could possibly be suggested of the
gentleman I had just met. My father told me on
our way home that he had asked him all manner of
questions, which he answered in the most businesslike
manner, and then he said, “I found I must ask
him a question, about his mania. ‘Have you or
have you not,’ I asked, ‘maintained that you are
our Saviour?’”</p>

<p>“I have,” he said, “and I can give you proofs,”
and he proceeded to ramble incoherently and
foolishly. “When he had finished,” continued
my father, “all I said was ‘Well, Mr. X., no doubt
you believe in it, and if you are asked about it you
must speak the truth, but in my humble opinion it
is not a strong point in our case.’</p>

<p>“‘You think not?’ asked Mr. X. eagerly.</p>

<p>“‘I am sure of it,’ said my father. ‘Absolutely
convinced of it.’ Mr. X. nodded his head thoughtfully,
and so the conference ended.”</p>

<p>When the case came on, Ballantine for the
<!--Page 036--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
relatives cross-examined Mr. X., who gave him very
admirable, straightforward answers, until the jury
shifted about uneasily and wondered why the man’s
liberty had been interfered with. At last Ballantine
came to the conclusion he must get to grips
with him, and suddenly asked him very sternly:
“I put it to you, that on several occasions you have
proclaimed yourself to be our Saviour? Is that
so? Yes or no.”</p>

<p>Mr. X. smiled.</p>

<p>“I have consulted my legal advisers on that point,”
he replied in a firm, quiet voice, “and they are all
clearly of opinion that it is not a strong point in
my case, and under those circumstances I must
decline to answer any questions about the matter.”</p>

<p>Ballantine could not get him to move from his
resolution, and he was restored to his liberty and his
estates.</p>

<p>My father and Ballantine were great rivals at
Westminster and on Circuit, and I remember my
father coming home with a capital story against himself
which he used to tell with much glee. He and
Ballantine were engaged in a case before Baron
Martin, and he heard a Scots clerk in whispered
tones pointing out to a friend from beyond Tweed
the various celebrities.</p>

<p>“Who is yon?” whispered the visitor, pointing
to the judge.</p>

<p>“Martin! Baron Martin,” replied the cicerone.
“He’s a grand mon, a great mon!”</p>

<p>“And the mon that’s speakin’ the noo!”</p>

<p><!--Page 037--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
“That’s Ballantine. He’s a great advocate. He’s
a grand mon!”</p>

<p>“And the big mon sitting next him?”</p>

<p>My father pricked up his ears intently. The
guide’s voice fell a semitone to a minor key. “That!
Oh, that’s Porry! Serjeant Porry. He’s a highly
over-r-rated mon.”</p>

<p>I wish my father could have lived long enough
for me to have heard him at his best at one of those
Garrick dinners, where he loved to get two or three
gathered together in the right place and enjoy
pleasant discourse over the walnuts and wine.
Good port and good stories were his hobbies. There
may be better ones, but I doubt it. And anyhow “so
long as a man rides his hobby-horse peacefully and
quietly along the King’s highway, and neither compels
you nor me to get up behind him&mdash;&#8203;pray, sir,
what have either you or I to do with it?” But if
I had had the sense or foresight to play the Boswell,
what a collection of good stories even I might have
chronicled. Years after he was gone I was brought
up to a London county court to fight an employers’
liability case, and the counsel against me was
Mr. Wildy Wright. Good-natured, obtrusive and
antique were his methods of advocacy, but I was
glad to have met him in the flesh, for he recalled to
my mind my father returning from Croydon Assizes
bubbling over with delight about a story of a “certain
judge” recently appointed and Mr. Wildy Wright.</p>

<p>The judge had been puzzled by a fierce objection
to evidence made by Mr. Wildy Wright, and reserved
<!--Page 038--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
his ruling on this point until he had consulted his
brother judge at the adjournment.</p>

<p>During the luncheon interval he put the point to
his brother, who was deeply puzzled.</p>

<p>“And who raised the point?” he asked after a
few moments of complicated thought.</p>

<p>“Wildy Wright.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied his brother with a sigh of relief,
“Wildy Wright! Overrule it. And if he makes
any other objections, overrule them too.”</p>

<p>The learned judge, much relieved, went back to
Court, and in courteous, silvern tones said,
“Mr. Wright, I have carefully considered the
objection you raised before the adjournment and
consulted my learned brother, and we are both
agreed that I ought to overrule it. And I may say
for your assistance that if in the course of the case
you make any other objections, I shall feel it my duty
to overrule those also.”</p>

<p>Now I begin to remember those old days and that
very happy home, I feel I should like to try and
paint many pictures of its happiness, but it would be
far from my purpose. All I wish to set down is that
from the very first, like Mr. Vincent Crummles’s
pony, who, you will remember, went on circuit all
his life, I was brought up among briefs and the talk
of law shop and the traditions of the profession. It
was always one of my ambitions to go to the Bar,
but I had very little hope then that it would be
realised. My elder brother, John Humffreys Parry,
who chose afterwards to go on the stage and, after
<!--Page 039--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
playing in America with Richard Mansfield, died
at the beginning of a brilliant career, was far
better equipped than I was to wear my father’s
robes when he should lay them down. Moreover,
in early life, to use a north-country phrase,
I “enjoyed” bad health. I had nearly every fever
known to physicians and fell into the surgeon’s
hands twice, breaking a collar-bone and nearly losing
my left hand with an accident arising out of and in
the course of my employment by running a chisel
through it whilst building a toy theatre. In these
and other ways my school-days were often interfered
with, and I have been “backward” as the phrase is
ever since.</p>

<p>And how things might have shaped themselves
had my father lived, I cannot say. But that was
not to be. For in January, 1880, with little warning,
a tragedy swept away the home that in my young
seeming was the one beautifully permanent, solid
fact in the whole world. My father and mother died
within a day of one another and were buried on the
same morning. And there was no home, only a
memory.</p>

<p class="p2">As a great writer says, “I am naturally averse to
egotism and hate self-laudation consumedly,” and
yet I must tell this story once again, for it seems to
me the natural motto of my undertaking. I was
passing up Peter Street away from my Court when
I heard two railway clerks discussing a case I had
just decided. This was their dialogue, with formal
parts, as we say in the law, omitted.</p>

<p>“1st Clerk: How the &mdash;&mdash; did he get to
£5?</p>

<p>“2nd Clerk: I don’t know.</p>

<p>“1st Clerk: I think he’s a &mdash;&mdash; fool.</p>

<p>“2nd Clerk: I think he’s a &mdash;&mdash; fool (a long
pause, then as an afterthought), but I think he
did his best.”</p>

<p>In the evening of the day on which I overheard that
excellent saying I was at a public dinner with no
reporters present&mdash;&#8203;not that their absence or presence
ever worried me very much, for the Manchester
reporters were all kind friends of mine, and stacked
the wild oats of my after-dinner chatter into very
<!--Page 041--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
neat sheaves of morning print. The fact, however,
enabled Dean Maclure to be expansive. In proposing
my health, after many sarcastic and amusing
allusions to my varied virtues, he expressed the
hope&mdash;&#8203;alas! not fulfilled&mdash;&#8203;that, as he alone could do
justice to the subject, he might live long enough to
write my epitaph.</p>

<p>That was the cue for the story, and I shall never
forget the Dean’s genial roar of laughter as I pictured
him unveiling in his beloved cathedral a little white
marble plaque, on which was cut in severe black
letters:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="chapter">

</div><!--end box-->

<p>I remind my readers of this story here at the
beginning of things, because, looking forward to the
round unvarnished tale I have to tell, I am very
conscious that I shall convince them of the justice of
the first part of the epitaph, and if I nothing
extenuate and set down naught but what is strictly
accurate, I am by no means sure that when the
faculty is applied for in the Ecclesiastical Court to
erect that little marble tribute to my memory someone
will not enter an appearance with these recollections
of mine exhibited to an affidavit, and move
to strike out the last line of the epitaph as
embarrassing and irrelevant.</p>

<p><!--Page 042--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
The first foolish thing I did in connection with my
twenty-five years sojourn in Manchester was to
come there at all. I remember Henn Collins&mdash;&#8203;then
a leader on the circuit&mdash;&#8203;telling me, with very clean-cut
emphasis, what he thought of my folly only a
week after I had settled down. It was the Peter
Street verdict, without the adjective, and this was
repeated to me by very many of the kind friends I
made in the first few months after my arrival.
Everyone asked me, “Why had I come to Manchester?”
and for the life of me I could not give
them a coherent and logical answer.</p>

<p>But there I was, a very junior barrister, with a very
junior wife and a still more junior daughter, all
desirous of being comfortably provided for; and to
my eternal gratitude and surprise, Manchester rose
to the occasion and not only&mdash;&#8203;to use the slang of the
tables&mdash;“saw me,” but “went one better” than my
best hopes in contributing to my career.</p>

<p>What little accidents determine the course of a
man’s life! We start like streams from the mountain
source, intending to fight our way down into the
valleys where our fathers have preceded us. But
on the upper slopes at the outset of our career we
meet some boulder or bank of earth and are turned
west instead of east, and so away into quite other
valleys and along towards another sea. If anyone
had told me when I was eighteen that I should be
County Court Judge of Manchester within fifteen
years I should have put a sovereign on the other way
or given the long odds in a hopeful spirit.</p>

<p><!--Page 043--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
For there was nothing of Manchester in my
thoughts when, after my father’s death, I left King’s
College School and gave up for ever those pleasant
journeys in the old underground railway, where we
learned our lessons by inferior gas-light in an atmosphere
of sulphur. Honestly, looking back on that
school in the underworld of Somerset House, I
have an uneasy feeling that there was no health in
it. But there were pleasant companions, and, if you
cared for such things, much classical learning and
Church doctrine. It did not occur to the boy mind
that light and air were necessary to healthy life,
and of course it had never entered the thoughts
of the pastors and masters responsible for that
scholastic warren. Whilst I was there I carried
away with me a few prizes and a broken nose, and a
knowledge of those portions of the Church Catechism
which fitted in with the place in class where I sat
of a Monday morning. I was sixteen when I left
school, and for the first time in my life began to
seriously consider the desirability of studying
things. I have been some sort of a student ever
since.</p>

<p>My first idea was to study mathematics with a
view to trying for a scholarship at Cambridge. I
wonder if I had followed that stream into what
dead sea it would have carried me. I know as a
fact that I was accounted fairly good at the subject,
but that is difficult for me to believe to-day, for
anything more complicated than very simple
addition I always refer in a thankful spirit to the
<!--Page 044--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
Registrar. Afterwards I fancied I would be an artist,
and joined the Slade School and drew in the
“Antique” for a few months. I got very little
encouragement there. Legros once looked at one of
my drawings, and took up a piece of charcoal as if
to show me some of the errors of line in my work;
but his heart failed him. He sighed, shook his head,
grunted a guttural French grunt of despair, and
turned on his heel. However, I can boast that I
am a pupil of Legros, and if he treasured my piece
of charcoal it may yet be a valuable lot at Christie’s&mdash;&#8203;who
knows?</p>

<p>At the end of 1881 I had made up my mind that
it was time to commence a career with money in it.
I chose the Bar because I knew no other. I went
down to the old courts at Westminster, and, finding
one of my father’s clerks, got him to take me to
Sir Henry James, as he then was. He was a very
old friend of my father, and not only signed the
necessary papers with pleasure, but introduced me
to Sir Farrer Herschell, who was sitting next to
him, and he signed as well. With such godfathers,
I was cordially received into the ancient house of
the Middle Temple, after satisfying two reverend
benchers that I knew enough Latin and history to
make it unwise for them to expose the amount of
their own knowledge of these subjects by asking me
further questions.</p>

<p>Thursday, January 19, 1882! More than
thirty years ago. And yet the memory of my
first dinner at the Temple is here to-day,
<!--Page 045--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
winnowed out of the myriad happenings of all
these years.</p>

<p>I see a thin slip of humanity shrinking among his
elders into that historical Elizabethan hall and
asking the old mace bearer with whispering humbleness
where he may sit. Unknowingly, he chooses
the place of captain of a mess&mdash;&#8203;the arbiter of the
feast of four&mdash;&#8203;and, taking courage from the unwonted
gown, brazens out his position until his want
of knowledge of the ceremonies concerning the first
glass of wine exposes him as a newcomer.</p>

<p>I know that there was plenty of genial talk and
laughter at that table, but I remember none of it.
For in my heart of hearts I was wondering why I had
come there at all, and feeling that the ghosts of all
the great Templars of the past were chuckling
among the rafters at my folly, and that, truly, I
was honest food for their mocks. But among
all my hopes and fears and forebodings Manchester
certainly had no place. Yet the “writing
on the wall” was there, or, rather, he was
sitting with his back to it on my left-hand side.
His name was Smith, and he came from Manchester.</p>

<p>Richard Smith, who sat next to me on the occasion
of my first dinner in hall, was my earliest experience
of Manchester, and indeed if I had never met him I
cannot suppose that I should ever have joined the
Northern Circuit. He had come to the Temple late
in life and was nearing his call. I believe he had
already been a bleacher, a dealer in pictures, and a
clerk to a public body. I know he had been at
<!--Page 046--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
Oxford, because in an unlucky moment on circuit
in a heated discussion after dinner he had called in
aid of his argument his University degree, and was
ever afterwards known as “Smith, B.A.” But for
me it was sufficient that he was the only man I ever
met in the Temple who could talk lovingly and
intelligently about pictures. He had the square
face of a lion, wearing in those days a heavy beard.
He barked and growled at you in argument and was
cocksure he was right. That is a very Manchester
virtue. I write of it with jealousy, for it is an
attribute I have vainly striven to acquire. You
know the story of one of Manchester’s most eminent
sons who was always in the right. Some friend
remonstrated with him gently, saying, “Why be
such an egoist?”</p>

<p>“Egoist!” was the calm reply. “I’m not an
egoist&mdash;&#8203;I know!”</p>

<p>And so it was with Dick Smith. He knew!
But, Micawber-like, he failed to persuade others to
take him at his own valuation. His venture at the
Bar was not a fortunate one. I like to remember
him, full of hope and enthusiasm spending a day or
two with me in the summer, sketching on the Thames
at Datchet, or playing chess in the common room in
the winter and laying down the law on every
conceivable subject in his rough, Manchester tongue.
When he left the Temple to start his practice in
Manchester, the Middle Temple common room
seemed to me for some days “remote, unfriended,
melancholy, slow.” But this was only a passing
<!--Page 047--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
mood. Dick Smith and his pride of Manchester
became a fading memory, and I continued to
thoroughly enjoy my three years’ work in the
Temple.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that men make a mistake
in rushing up from the University to eat their dinners
and getting called to the Bar directly they leave
college. Law is, at least, as uncertain and dangerous
a science to the patient as medicine, and the
student of law should be compelled to “walk” the
courts, as the medical student is compelled to
“walk” the hospitals. For my part, I attribute
what success I had at the Bar to the fact that I
worked at the practical business of the profession
for three years before I was called. I read in
different chambers, and during the last year of
student days had the privilege of reading with my
Danckwerts, who was and is, no doubt, one of the
greatest lawyers of our day. It is curious to remember
that in 1884 the gossip of the Temple was
concerned in discussing whether Danckwerts or
Asquith would succeed R. S. Wright as Treasury
“devil,” so blind are the quidnuncs to the throw
of the shuttle of fate.</p>

<p>A junior with such a heavy practice as
Danckwerts’s cannot do much more than give you
the run of his chambers, but that, as Loehnis said,
was like “turning a team of asses into a field of
oats.” Loehnis devilled for Danckwerts in those
days. He was a shrewd, sound lawyer and a kind-hearted
senior to our pupil room, and the Bar lost
<!--Page 048--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
an honourable and learned brother by his untimely
death. Considering the work he did and the hours
he worked, it was wonderful how much personal
attention Danckwerts gave to his pupils. He would
often call one of us into his room and discuss some
opinion or pleading we had drawn. I remember on
one occasion, having pointed out to me the hopeless
errors of the legal opinion I had given, he wound up
his remarks by saying: “And suppose, when you
are called, you get a case of that kind, what is going
to happen to you?”</p>

<p>“When I get a case of that importance,” I
replied, “I shall certainly insist on having you as a
junior.”</p>

<p>The great man laughingly agreed that I had made
a wise resolution.</p>

<p>Bertram Cox was undoubtedly the ablest pupil in
my time. He neglected an ordinary career at the
Bar and specialised on heavy public legal work, and
was rightly rewarded by being appointed legal Under-Secretary
to the Colonial Office&mdash;&#8203;a position which I
believe Mr. Chamberlain invented in order that the
office might have the benefit of his services. He is
now the solicitor to the Inland Revenue. Another
pupil was Bartle Frere, who is a legal luminary
at Gibraltar. Danckwerts seemed to instil into his
pupils the capacity to arrive. Frere was one of the
merriest fellows in the world, always doing some
careless and amusing thing, on the strength of which
Cox and I built up apocryphal stories about him
which we insisted upon as traditions of the pupil
<!--Page 049--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
room. Thus it was asserted to be Frere who, after
carefully studying the papers in an action for
seduction, had drafted a defence of contributory
negligence. I believe, however, there was some
foundation for the story that in his early days he
wrote an opinion to the effect that, as every step
taken up to date on behalf of the plaintiff was useless,
the best thing he could do was to drop his present
action and commence an action for negligence against
his solicitor.</p>

<p>“Excellent advice, no doubt,” said Danckwerts
dryly, “but you seem to forget that we are advising
the solicitor.”</p>

<p>The last time I met Frere was in Norwich, about
1896. I had gone to sit as judge for Addison, and
took my seat in the old Castle Court with great
dignity, bowing to the Bar, when I looked up and
my eye caught Frere’s.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, it’s Parry!” he cried out in
an audible voice, and laughed heartily at the idea
of finding me on the bench. The Court did not
hear the interruption, but Parry did, and enjoyed
it hugely. We dined at the Maid’s Head that
evening, and had a pleasant crack together, recalling
many stories of the old pupil room in New
Court. No doubt memory brightens o’er the past,
but certainly no youngsters ever learned their
business under pleasanter auspices than we did.</p>

<p>Outside the pupil room there were lectures to
attend, scholarships to be read for, dinners in the old
hall, and debating clubs meeting on several evenings
<!--Page 050--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
in the week. Mindful of my father’s advice, I had
always kept in touch with an old boys’ debating club
at King’s College School, and now I joined the
Hardwicke and a very pleasant and more social club,
the Mansfield. The Hardwicke was a conservative
institution, and I remember startling the ancients of
our benches by raising a debate on the effect of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement on the art of the country.
Everyone spoke on it, and the frank expressions of
dogmatic ignorance and the enthusiastic denunciations
of the works of the school were thoroughly
healthy and entertaining. Still, we mustered a
stalwart minority, and a little later gained a practical
victory over the Philistines. I was elected
on the committee of the Hardwicke, on which
Clavell Salter&mdash;&#8203;now a K.C. and M.P. for the
Basingstoke division&mdash;&#8203;was an important official.
The society was in funds, and we resolved to
spend them in creature comforts; not in olive
draperies and sunflowers, perhaps, but in reasonable
luxuries. Our meeting room was at that
time floored with boards, the door opening from
the road banged violently whenever anyone entered,
and the uncovered gas-jets in the centre glared and
hissed at you distressingly during your oration.
Without a word of our purpose to the general body
of members we adorned the room with a carpet, a
screen to hide the door, and some glass globes for the
gas. Incensed with indignation and breathing fire
and war, the hosts of the Old Bailey came down upon
us in wrath. Geoghan the eloquent, Cagney the
<!--Page 051--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
persuasive, and the subtle Burnie closured our
debate, carried the suspension of the standing orders,
and on a motion to surcharge the upstart members
of the committee rent the air with denunciations of
our malversation of the funds and our want of
patriotism in destroying the ancient amenities of
their beloved Hardwicke. It was with difficulty
that our side continued the debate, which was of an
earnest and fiery nature, until the hour of the
adjournment. By next week we whipped up our
supporters, who were base enough to prefer comfort
to tradition, and we remained in office. The prophecies
of decadence and disaster came to naught.
The Hardwicke survives in prosperity. Long may
it flourish.</p>

<p>This habit of debate and discussion naturally led
us to desire to try our strength in a wider field of
battle. Some took one side and some another,
but for myself, from hereditary example perhaps, I
have always been fond of belonging to a minority;
and now that I have been a total abstainer from
politics for many years, I may freely admit that in
the eighties I was an ardent Radical, and, naturally,
a disciple of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, who in that
day was preaching the reforms that Mr. Lloyd George
is now putting on the Statute Book. I was a
member of the Eighty Club, then a Whig institution,
and as Radical speakers were greatly in demand I got
many opportunities of political speaking all over the
country. As a very young Radical in a minority
among many superior persons, it was, of course, part
<!--Page 052--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
of my duty to criticise my elders and betters whenever
I got the opportunity. As an artist friend said
of me, I had an unfortunate habit of “getting out of
drawing,” even outside the studio, and I remember
very well an instance of this at a dinner given in the
autumn of 1895 to Trevelyan. It was the custom of
the club for a senior to propose and a junior to second
a vote of thanks to our guest. On this occasion
Haldane was the senior and I was the junior. I had
made up an eloquent little speech, but in accordance
with my usual habit&mdash;&#8203;then and now&mdash;&#8203;I made another.
Haldane had&mdash;&#8203;as I thought rather unnecessarily&mdash;&#8203;made
a great many allusions to the “nephew of
Lord Macaulay,” as though Trevelyan bore no other
claim to fame. When my turn came I got a round
of applause for welcoming our guest as himself, a
personality far more interesting to the working
politician of to-day than the mere nephew of a Whig
peer. Trevelyan himself seemed to enjoy the joke,
and wound up the proceedings by an appeal to the
younger members for missionary work, in which he
referred very pleasantly to some of my father’s
Radical fights of old days, and congratulated me on
belonging to the true faith.</p>

<p>I was naturally rather elated as I walked home
along the Embankment with our energetic honorary
secretary, J. A. B. B. Bruce&mdash;&#8203;the Busy Bee, as we
called him.</p>

<p>“No doubt, Parry,” he said in his quiet, thoughtful
way, “you think you’ve been jolly clever, but
what I’m wondering is when Haldane is Lord
<!--Page 053--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
Chancellor, and you want a County Court judgeship,
will you get it?”</p>

<p>I hope it is not lese-majeste for me to repeat this
story to-day, when at length the hopes of the Temple
have been fulfilled and the double event which
Bruce foresaw has come to pass. It was a commonplace
of Temple talk that some day Haldane would
be Lord Chancellor, but it required the deep foresight
of Bruce to hazard the suggestion that I should
ever be in a position to apply for a judgeship of the
County Court.</p>

<p>And I cannot look back on those old days without
seeing the figure of one dear friend&mdash;&#8203;the bravest
and kindest of men, Archie Stewart. I know this,
that no one who came within his sway can have
forgotten his memory, and there must yet be many
in the Temple who will be glad to recall it. Tall,
handsome, broad-shouldered and erect, swinging
with a curious gait across the courts of the Temple,
one could not but be attracted by his presence.
His frank, engaging smile, his cheery voice all alike
evidenced the joy of life. And yet when he entered
the library and the attendant stepped up to him
and lifted off his coat with its heavy cape, you saw
at a glance the tragedy that his brave heart never
acknowledged. Both his arms were paralysed and
deformed from childhood and were practically
useless. He could write slowly and with difficulty,
pushing the pen by a movement of the
shoulder, but in nearly every ordinary movement
in life, in eating, dressing, carrying and lifting,
<!--Page 054--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
he required assistance. And yet he would start
away from Kensington in the morning and come
down to the Temple, leaving his servant at home
in the knowledge that throughout London he
would always find someone to help him. When
you got used to his movements you did not seem
to notice his deformity, so little did he make of it
himself, and so cleverly did he use the little strength
and capacity there were in his hands and arms.
The things that he could do were wonderful. A light
wineglass he could lift with his lips, drink from it and
replace it almost gracefully, and he could pick up a
weighted chessman&mdash;&#8203;it was his favourite game, and
he played above the ordinary&mdash;&#8203;in his mouth and hurl
it accurately on to any square on the board. His
favourite method was to steer the men along with
his pipe, but in moments of triumph and enthusiasm
he seized them in his lips. He was a constant
speaker at the Hardwicke&mdash;&#8203;clear, shrewd and
learned. How he read so much and had conquered
his enormous difficulties it is hard to understand.
Among other things achieved, he had learned to
swim, and he could cast a bowl from his instep
with cunning, skill and accuracy. In due course he
was called to the Bar, and whenever I came to town
I used to turn into our old chambers in Pump Court,
and find Stewart smoking like a furnace and laying
down the law to some junior in large practice who
had come round to have a few words with him about
a difficulty. It was curious how many men accounted
learned in the law were well pleased to have
<!--Page 055--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
their views ratified or reformed by Archie Stewart.
I remember hearing him hold at bay a Divisional
Court, consisting of Coleridge, C.J., and R. S.
Wright, J., with a learned argument about a demand
for rent at common law, in which he gave them an
interesting dissertation on the legal history and
archæology of the matter, with few notes and, of
course, without books, for he was unable to hold
them. The Court rightly complimented him on his
performance, and thinking ahead in those days I used
to imagine what a great judge my friend would have
made, with his bright logical Scots mind and his deep
sympathy with human nature down to the lowest,
which he had learned from the respect and kindness
shown to his misfortune. He told me that
in all his wanderings about London day and night
alone no one had ever offered to rob him, though he
was in the habit of asking any stranger to take his
money out of his pocket to pay railway or other
fares. I was not the only one who predicted for
Stewart some position of honour in his profession.
But it was not to be. Very suddenly one summer
holiday he was taken. It was at his home at
Rannoch. He belonged to an ancient race of
Stewarts, and in his quaint way used to boast that
if he were to sue for the Crown <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in formâ pauperis</i>
there would be flutterings in high places. Some
years afterwards I made a pious journey to his
resting-place. In his ancestral park, on which the
blue peak of his beloved Schiehallion looks down,
there, surrounded by grey stone walls and tall
<!--Page 056--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
fir trees, he lies among cross-legged knights in armour,
tall well-limbed warriors of his race, but among
them all there is not one who fought the fight with
a braver heart than the last comer.</p>

<p>It begins to dawn upon me that all these beckoning
shadows and calling shapes which throng into my
memory when I begin to write of my student days
in the Temple are keeping me too long from the main
purpose of my story, but in my next chapter I will
at least get called to the Bar, and then, as there will
be no work for me in town, I shall have to pack
up my bundle and go into the wide, wide world to
seek my fortune.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">CALLED TO THE BAR</h4>

<p class="small unindent">&mdash;&#8203;is it not well that there should be what we call Professions,
or Bread-studies (<span class="title">Brodzwecke</span>) pre-appointed us? Here, circling
like the gin-horse, for whom partial or total blindness is no evil,
the Bread-artist can travel contentedly round and round, still
fancying that it is forward and forward, and realise much: for
himself victual; for the world an additional horse’s power in
the grand corn-mill or hemp-mill of Economic Society.</p>

<p class="flushright p1 small"><span class="sc">Carlyle</span>: “Sartor Resartus.”</p>

<p class="p2">In 1884 I was appointed by Mr. Justice Mathew
to the first legal office I had the honour to hold, and
went with him on the Oxford Circuit as judge’s
marshal. Mr. Justice Mathew was a very old
friend of my father, and was one of the team that
prosecuted Arthur Orton for perjury. Of those
five, three survivors now remained; Hawkins,
Mathew, and Bowen, and all were on the bench. A
judge’s marshal has one official duty; he swears
in the grand jury. His other duties are to act as the
judge’s secretary, to see that everything in the judge’s
lodgings runs smoothly, and to suffer admonition
gladly if anything goes wrong. At the end of the
circuit Mathew said at least this in my favour&mdash;&#8203;that
I was the only marshal he had ever had who
could carve a chicken and open a soda-water bottle
without injuring the carpets.</p>

<p><!--Page 058--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
We went the Oxford Summer Circuit. Butt was
our brother judge. It was a delightful and valuable
experience. Mathew was an ideal judge in criminal
cases, and I have never forgotten a maxim he was
very fond of quoting and acting upon: “When the
prisoner is undefended the judge must be his
advocate.” In altered terms, it is a counsel of perfection
for a County Court judge or any magisterial
person who has the poor always before him. To
see him double the part of prisoner’s advocate and
judge was to witness a masterpiece of subtle wit and
honesty. There has been much discussion of late
about the bias of judges. To my thinking a judge
without bias would be a monstrosity. Mathew was
an Irishman and a Liberal. But I never remember
his bias interfering with a straight delivery; unless,
indeed, it was on the trial of an undefended Irish
poacher at Oxford. There truly the Liberal
disappeared in the judge, but I think the Irishman
swerved a little from the true line. Anyhow,
Mercy had her way, and the poacher was acquitted.</p>

<p>There were many who regarded Mathew with
something like terror, and for the life of me why one
with so kindly a heart should have rejoiced on
occasion in appearing as a man of wrath I cannot say.
Perhaps it was that if he followed on all occasions
his humane instincts he felt that discipline would
not be maintained, and that he was really, as it
were, taking gymnastic moral exercise in working
himself into histrionic anger about nothing in particular.
There was generally a sense of humour
<!--Page 059--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
in these displays which the sufferer was often too
agitated to enjoy. I remember on one occasion an
unfortunate sheriff had spelt and printed and
published Mathew’s name on the calendar with two
t’s. The judge sent for him and received him in the
drawing-room of our lodgings in grave state. He
explained to the High Sheriff, who stood quaking
before him in a yeomanry uniform, that the offence
he had committed might well be regarded not as
petty treason, but as high treason, being in effect
an insult through him as Judge of Assize to Her
Majesty herself. He sent for Butt and solemnly
discussed with him whether he was not in duty
bound to fine the unlucky sheriff at least £500. Butt,
who was never more delighted than when he could
play his part in a jest, for some time seriously agreed
with Mathew, and the two discussed whether imprisonment
was necessary as well. Then Butt began
to think the fun had gone on long enough, and took
the sheriff’s side and begged his forgiveness. But
Mathew, who was really vexed at slovenliness of this
kind, dismissed the sheriff and adjourned his decision
until the morning, “for,” said he in Cromwellian
phrase and intention, “the fellow must be taught
his place.”</p>

<p>But on another and more amusing occasion he
caused grave fright to Lister Drummond, my brother
marshal. Drummond was an ardent Catholic&mdash;&#8203;a
convert, I believe&mdash;&#8203;and of course Mathew belonged
to a very old Catholic family. I fear we
marshals must have been somewhat of a trial
<!--Page 060--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
to our respective judges, and every now and
then Mathew would put his foot down. One
morning we both arrived at breakfast rather later
than usual. Mathew was reading the paper and
eating his bacon alone, and looked at us in a very
Johnsonian and surly manner, and only grunted
a reply to our greetings. Breakfast proceeded in
silence until the judge had finished, when he put
down his paper and said:</p>

<p>“Whose bedroom is next to mine?”</p>

<p>“I believe mine is, Judge,” I said with hesitancy.</p>

<p>“Hm! Then who on earth was talking to you
until two in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” I replied more cheerfully, seeing
a mischievous retreat, “it was Drummond, but
I’m sure you will approve of it when I tell you that
he wants to convert me to the Holy Faith!”</p>

<p>“Does he?” roared Mathew, banging his fist on
the table and glaring at Drummond. “Then you
may take it straight from me, Drummond, that if
you continue to convert Parry in the small hours of
the morning, I leave the Church.”</p>

<p>He swept out of the room, leaving Drummond as
limp as the jackdaw of Rheims.</p>

<p>Mathew had a considerable power of acting, and
could have taken a hand with the best in the old
sport of quizzing or “smoking” the victim, which is
known to the moderns under the name of the game
of spoof. I remember well when we were travelling
to some cathedral town I was specifically ordered
to get copies of a ribald and amusing local paper
<!--Page 061--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
called the <cite>Bat</cite>, or the <cite>Porcupine</cite>, or the <cite>Jackdaw</cite>, or
some such sarcastic beast or bird. This I did, and
the two judges thoroughly enjoyed an open letter in
it to my Lord Bishop of the diocese. The next
evening the Lord Bishop dined with us in state, with
other dignitaries of the city. When we retired to
the drawing-room, there on the table, duly arranged
with the <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Spectator</cite>, the <cite>Law Journal</cite> and
other staid prints, were the blatant covers of the
offending papers. They caught the Lord Bishop’s
eye. He frowned and looked gravely on the carpet.
Mathew, with his ready observation, noticed the
episcopal uneasiness. He stepped to the table in
sudden anger. He seized the offending copies and
turned to me with a look of grave sorrow, illuminated
by a tactful quiver of the left eyelid.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this disgraceful? I can’t hinder you from
wasting your money on such trash. But to bring
them into the judges’ rooms and leave them lying
about here&mdash;&mdash;” He stepped to the fireplace and
threw them into the fire with a sigh. “Surely,
Parry&mdash;&#8203;surely you do not need to be told not to
do such things.”</p>

<p>And once more the Bishop smiled a smile of
righteousness and peace.</p>

<p>It was only a few weeks’ experience, but it stands
out as one of the times when I learned something of
the technic of advocacy. I was only a “walker on”
to the stage of the Court, it is true, but I was on all
the time, and could take note of the courses of the
stars. Henry Matthews, Q.C., and Jelf, Q.C., were
<!--Page 062--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
doing constant battle in the Civil Court, and Darling
was defending poachers and other offenders on the
Crown side. There was plenty of good example for
the apprentice to study. And in between whiles
we rowed our judges down the Wye to Chepstow and
nearly spilled them in the river, and journeyed to
Edgbaston to kiss Cardinal Newman’s ring, and
visited under the pleasantest circumstances the old
houses and castles and cathedrals of the Midlands;
as if all the world were playing holidays when you
went the Oxford Circuit in summer.</p>

<p>At the end of 1884 I was married, and in January,
1885, I was called to the Bar. I determined to go
my father’s old circuit, the South-Eastern, and went
down to Cambridge and Norwich and Maidstone to
look round, but came to the conclusion that there
was woefully little to do and plenty of able men to do
it. I took a room in Middle Temple Lane in the old
wooden building on the left as you turn out of Fleet
Street. My name was painted on the door, but I
doubt if anyone read it but myself. I wrote some
stories for the <cite>Cornhill</cite>, started a law book that was
never finished, and began editing Dorothy Osborne’s
letters. As the Bar did not require my services, and
I thought the country did, I made many excursions
for the Eighty Club.</p>

<p>I spoke several times for an old friend of mine,
Tom Threlfall, head of the Salford Brewery, who had
come out as a Liberal against the Hon. Edward
Stanhope in the Horncastle Division of Lincolnshire.
The agricultural labourer was coming into his own,
<!--Page 063--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
and the clergy often refused us the use of the schools,
so we spoke from a wagon in a field. We had a knot
of independent farmers who supported the cause, and
we all drove together in a big brake to the place of
meeting. I shall never forget a serious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> of
Threlfall’s. We were passing between two fields
heavily manured with the favourite Lincolnshire
dressing, and all the farmers sniffed it up with smiling
approval. It was too much for Threlfall, and he
buried his face in an elegant cambric handkerchief.
One of the farmers frowned slightly, and, by way of
encouraging explanation, said: “Eh, man! Pig
moock! Fine!”</p>

<p>The farmers were sorely puzzled at his want of
appreciation, and I could not help feeling that
Threlfall was not really cut out for a Lincolnshire
member. Unfortunately, the voters thought so, too;
but he made an excellent fight.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, at an old boys’ dinner at
King’s College after the election Sir Richard
Webster, as he then was, proposed my health as
president of the debating society, and chaffed me for
belonging to the wrong camp; but I was able to point
out that I had done good work for both parties, for I
had spoken for fifteen Radical candidates and not one
of them had been returned.</p>

<p>The fact was that at that date the followers of
Chamberlain and his “unauthorised programme,”
as it was called, were under the grave disadvantage
of working against the ill-concealed hostility of the
moderate Liberals.</p>

<p><!--Page 064--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
I expect when the history of the time is known
it will be found that when Gladstone nominated
Rosebery as his successor instead of Chamberlain he
naturally destined his party to their long sojourn in
the wilderness. Certainly in 1885 Chamberlain was
as great a name to conjure with as it is to-day. I
was present at Bristol at the Liberal Colston dinner
just before the autumn election, and shall never
forget the enormous enthusiasm with which his name
was received.</p>

<p>With the exception of Gladstone, I have never
heard a speaker who could play upon any given
audience as a musician upon a great organ, pulling
out first this stop and then another, and winding up
with some diapason of eloquence, some grand
swelling burst of harmony, that made speaker and
audience, player and organ, one vast instrument of
triumph.</p>

<p>The most wonderful instance of his magnetic
influence and power that I ever witnessed was when
he dined with the Eighty Club on April 28, 1885.
It was an open secret that the majority of the club
did not want him to be invited, but a Cabinet
Minister could not be passed over. The audience
was apathetic. They laughed awkwardly when he
introduced himself as one “who certainly has never
worshipped with Whigs in the Temple of Brooks’s.”
He seemed to get no echo from his audience and
became uneasy. He was speaking from notes piled
up on a heap of oranges in a high dessert dish.
Suddenly I saw him drop a page back on to the
<!--Page 065--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
heap&mdash;&#8203;he left his notes and his voice rang out
amongst us in a graphic picture of a Birmingham
slum and the children crying for milk, and the
shameful contrast of the well-fed, sleek mob in front
of him. Melodrama, perhaps, but rattling good
melodrama. It made Radicals for the moment of
every Whig in the room, and when he returned to his
notes and quoted from the “Corn Law Rhymer,” in
tones of triumphant fervour:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="i2">They turned to bane and mockery&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">cheers echoed and re-echoed, and there was not an
ounce of Whig left in his audience.</p>

<p>Alas! the whirligig of Time brings in his revenges.
In a few years Chamberlain had an entirely new set
of politics, and I had none whatever.</p>

<p>Eighty-six dawned, but the sun did not shine very
brightly in Middle Temple Lane. I had one or two
briefs, certainly, but there seemed no outlook. The
South-Eastern Circuit was a far too expensive
amusement for my pocket, and, now that the election
was over, there seemed nothing to do but to write
stories that ungrateful editors did not want and to
sit in chambers waiting for unintelligent solicitors
who never came.</p>

<p>It was one winter afternoon. My boy was out
at lunch. I was sitting in that upper chamber in
Middle Temple Lane wondering if there would be
<!--Page 066--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
more room for my interesting personality in Australia
than there seemed to be in the old country when I
heard an eager, heavy footstep on the last flight.
Footsteps generally stopped at the top of the flight
before, where an eminent Old Bailey junior held out.
These footsteps came upward and along; they were
unknown and substantial. Evidently those of a
solicitor&mdash;&#8203;of weight. I felt that something important
was going to happen.</p>

<p>There was no knock at the door, and in a moment
who should fling himself into the room but Dick
Smith.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of good living up all these stairs; you
should begin on the ground floor. Time enough to
come up here when you are all the fashion and the
solicitors must come after you.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing in town?” I asked.</p>

<p>“M‘Lachlan <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="versus">.v</abbr></i> Agnew and Others. Rolls Court,
before Anderson, Official Referee. Pankhurst leads
me, but he has gone back to Manchester. Shiress
Will, Q.C., and Lewis Coward against us. What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever,” I answered somewhat
dismally.</p>

<p>“Come along and take a note for me this afternoon.”</p>

<p>I had been feeling like a gambler eternally cut
out of the table, and here was a hand in some sort
of game dealt for me to pick up. I caught hold of
my blue bag, and putting a note on my door with
some pride to say I was to be found at the Official
<!--Page 067--><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
Referee’s Chambers in Rolls Court, followed Dick
Smith up Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>There is a geographical secret about Chancery
Lane that I have discovered. It leads straight to
Manchester.</p>

<p>M‘Lachlan <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="versus">.v</abbr></i> Agnew and Others should never
have happened at all. It came about mainly because
Lachlan M‘Lachlan was a Scotsman and a photographer,
and knew that he knew everything about
art&mdash;&#8203;in which he mistakenly included photography&mdash;&#8203;whilst
the defendants, Sir William Agnew, Sir Joseph
Heron, and Mr. Alderman King, knew that they
knew better than M‘Lachlan.</p>

<p>Each set out to prove his thesis to Mr. Anderson,
Q.C., in his dingy chambers in Rolls Court. Neither
succeeded, but perhaps Anderson learned something
about art and the parties something about law.</p>

<p>Lachlan M‘Lachlan’s pet idea was that a camera
not only could not lie, but that it could tell the truth,
and even interpret new or historic truths pictorially.
He conceived the loyal and patriotic idea of a great
picture, to be entitled “The Royal Family,” which was
to depict a group consisting of every member of the
Royal Family surrounding our Gracious Sovereign
Queen Victoria in one of the rooms at Windsor.
Each individual was to be separately photographed,
the room and its furniture were to be photographed
in detail, and then the photographs were to be
enlarged, cut out, and pasted on a huge canvas, from
which was to be painted a picture of great size.
When this was done the camera again came into play.
<!--Page 068--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
Negatives of various sizes were to be taken, and the
ultimate prints sold to the public.</p>

<p>I have very little doubt there was some artistic
value in the original design of the group, for that was
the work of that sincere artist Frederic Shields, and
his sketch group, which was prepared in 1871, won
the approval of her Majesty the Queen, who not only
gave M‘Lachlan several sittings herself, but issued
her mandate to the various members of the Royal
Family that they were to be photographed in such
dresses, uniforms, and attitudes as Lachlan M‘Lachlan
desired. The various adventures of M‘Lachlan in
pursuit of his Royal victims would fill a volume.
This part of the work took some two or three years,
and the great scheme nearly failed because a
Princess who had in the meanwhile grown out of
short skirts refused to put them on again to satisfy
M‘Lachlan’s passion for historical accuracy. This
matter was&mdash;&#8203;so M‘Lachlan used to tell us&mdash;&#8203;referred
to her Majesty and decided in his favour.</p>

<p>In 1874 the first photographs were completed,
but the plaintiff had exhausted his means in working
on his great project, which required new capital
before it could be finished. There is, I think, no
doubt that the defendants were actuated in the
first instance by the kindest motives, and through
their influence about twenty guarantors found £100
apiece in order that the wonderful historical picture
might be made.</p>

<p>M‘Lachlan had the faith and enthusiasm of a
patentee. No expense could be too great, no time
<!--Page 069--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
too long to assure the perfection of his work. The
defendants, on the other hand, regarded themselves
as the kindly patron of the poor artist, ready to lend
him some money, but eager to see it return again
with that huge additional interest that is the modern
Mæcenas’s expectation when he deigns to encourage
literature or art. Such a combination could but end
in one place&mdash;&#8203;the law courts, though it took many
years to reach its natural destination.</p>

<p>I think it was nearly 1877 before the great canvas
picture was produced. It measured 17 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> by
10 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> 6 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr>, and was insured by the defendants for
£10,000. Even when the picture was finished there
were long delays in producing the negatives of different
sizes. More money was wanted, and deeds and
agreements were drawn up, unauthorised prints
were condemned by M‘Lachlan and issued by the
defendants, and meanwhile the portraits were
becoming more and more historical, and a
picture that might have had some popularity in
1871 had little chance of success some ten years
later.</p>

<p>It was in March of 1885 that the case was opened
at Manchester Assizes. Dr. Pankhurst was for the
plaintiff. No one on the circuit could have trumpeted
forth the wrongs of M‘Lachlan with more eloquent
indignation, and few juniors could have enveloped
the court in a foggier atmosphere of financial
complications. In tones of emotion and excitement
the learned doctor’s voice would soar into a falsetto
of denunciation of his opponents’ chicanery, winding
<!--Page 070--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
up in a cry to heaven&mdash;&#8203;or whatever Pankhurst put
in its place&mdash;&#8203;that their villainy might be punished.
It was not, indeed, wholly without justification that
some wild circuit rhymer wrote in Falkner Blair’s
“Lament on Going to India”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">When I hear in the midst of the jungle O</div>
  <div class="i2">The shriek of the wild cockatoo,</div>
  <div class="i0">I shall jump out of bed in my bungalow</div>
  <div class="i2">And imagine, dear Pankhurst, it’s you.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>It is, of course, easy enough to make fun of a great
man’s mannerisms, but Dr. Pankhurst, as a witty
conversationalist, an eloquent speaker who could
keep his subject well before a mixed audience on a
high plane of thought, and a man of earnest convictions
in moral and political affairs, was honestly
admired by all who had the pleasure of his friendship.
But it must be admitted that at the Bar
he was not at his best. He could not readily sink
to the mundane problems by solving which so many
disputes are decided. I remember on a Local
Government Board inquiry, presided over by Colonel
Ducat, the engineer of the Board, I appeared for
one district and Pankhurst for another. We were
opposing inclusion into a larger district. Pankhurst,
as senior, started the harangues by throwing
up his arms and shouting out on a top note, “I am
here to justify the opposition of the down-trodden
minority of the Stand District. I say I am here to
justify the opposition of the down-trodden minority
of the Stand District.”</p>

<p>And justify it he did in passages of great eloquence,
<!--Page 071--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
close reasoning, and apposite quotation from history
and literature, which were a pleasure and privilege to
listent to. When it was all over, and his adherents’
applause had died away, Colonel Ducat looked
up from his notes and said: “I’ve listened very
carefully, Dr. Pankhurst, but I’m not clear even
now whether you are in favour of the 12-inch drains
or the 9-inch drains.”</p>

<p>I should like to have heard Pankhurst open
M‘Lachlan’s case. Mr. Justice Hawkins listened to
it for three days. At the end of that time figures
were mentioned, and Hawkins got frightened, and
promptly referred the matter. What a waste of
time and money to have started it at all. It was a
year afterwards, in the middle of the reference, that
I found the case rolling heavily along, a mass of
negatives and photography and correspondence
and confusion. Pankhurst was unable to continue
in the case, and they gave me a junior brief to
Richard Smith. I never really understood what the
quarrel was all about, but I do not think anyone
else did, unless it was Smith, who made an excellent
reply for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>I only remember one smile during the many
weary hours we spent in those dingy chambers
in Rolls Court. Sir William Agnew was being
examined. He was always somewhat pompous
and well-to-do in his manner, and Smith did his
best to annoy him. A question arose as to the
authenticity of a letter written by the plaintiff
on Agnew’s Bond Street letter paper.</p>

<p><!--Page 072--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
“I suppose,” said Smith, “if any customer in
your shop&mdash;&#8203;I beg your pardon, emporium&mdash;&#8203;were to
ask one of your servants for a sheet of notepaper,
he would give him one?”</p>

<p>“I hope not, sir,” said Sir William, with expansive
dignity, “I hope he would hand him two or three.”</p>

<p>Old Anderson looked at Sir William in Scot’s
surprise, and said in his broadest accent, “Do you
really mean that, now?”</p>

<p>I do not think I ever saw the ultimate written
judgment of the Official Referee. I believe both
sides appealed from it, and no appeal was ever
heard. It was, from the point of view of English
litigation, one of our failures. There ought to be a
compulsory conciliation court for troubles of this
nature, at least to sift out what the quarrel and
dispute really is. But I look back to the case with
pleasure. I don’t think the result left M‘Lachlan
worse than it found him, and it certainly did me a
good turn. During those days I heard from Smith of
the wonderful possibilities of the Bar in Manchester,
and I made up my mind I would at least join the
Northern Circuit. This I did without delay, and
before the summer I had taken a little house in
Heaton Road, Withington, and turned my back
on London for ever.</p>

<p>Just to show what a lot I knew about Manchester,
I moved down in Whit-week&mdash;&#8203;or tried to. For
Manchester has an excellent and sacred custom in
Whit-week. Nobody does any work.</p>

mills, the great bale-laden drays, the magnificent horses.</p>

<p class="flushright small p1">“Towards Democracy.”</p>

<p class="p2">And by moving down to Manchester in Whit-week
I found myself indeed plunged into a new world.
For Whit-week, as I said, is a universal holiday
among all sorts and conditions of people, and every
man, woman and child has his or her share in the
feast. For the shops close, the workman goes to
Blackpool or the Isle of Man, and the employer to
Paris or the West Highlands, or St. Andrews, or
North Berwick as the mood suggests, and Lancashire
and Yorkshire play cricket at Old Trafford and the
races are run, and the children dressed in white,
carrying their banners, move in procession through
streets thronged with admiring parents. And that
all may be at peace and good will the Protestant
children “walk”&mdash;&#8203;that is the Manchester word&mdash;&#8203;on
one day and the Roman Catholics on another, for
fear the good Christian parents of either denomination
should batter each other’s skulls whilst their
little children are singing “Lead Kindly Light.”
And if you want to see one of the prettiest sights
<!--Page 074--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
in the land, go and see the children “walking,” the
little Catholics for choice, because their frocks are
daintier and their banners more picturesque, and
their parents in the crowd, among whom you should
stand, are more Irish, enthusiastic and full of
epigram. But by no means go to Manchester in
Whit-week if you want to buy or sell. And if you
have to move into a new house it is obviously not
the right season to make the attempt, for at this
season no money or entreaty will save your vans
from being held up, and you may make up your
mind to lay your carpets yourself. When you
become a citizen of Manchester you recognise the
sanity of the Whit-week festival. It comes at a time
when days are long, weather favourable, the despair
of winter behind you and the joy of summer at your
feet. Some day all England will acquire the Whit-week
habit, and it will cease to be the special luxury
of Manchester.</p>

<p>As there was no possibility of work or any kind
of progress in domestic affairs, I had ample leisure
to survey the city and study its geography. My
earliest impressions were not prepossessing. The
town of Manchester seemed to consist of one
long street&mdash;&#8203;Market Street&mdash;&#8203;which was far too
small for the trams and lurries and men and women
who wanted to use it. All the other streets seemed
half empty, and this one was overcrowded. The
costumes of the inhabitants struck me as grotesque.
Men’s gloves were only to be seen in the shop
windows, and I wondered why they were there at
<!--Page 075--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
all, but discovered afterwards that the devout
carried them to church or chapel on Sundays. Top
hats were worn, certainly, but generally with light
tweed suits. Frock coats were surmounted by
boating straws, and I remember the shock experienced
by my Cockney mind when I met a native
clothed in correct black coat and silk hat in Albert
Square ruining his chances in life, as I thought, by
the added blasphemy of a short pipe. It must not
be thought that I sighed deeply for the Babylonish
garments of the Temple, for I soon learned that in
Manchester, of all places, you might</p>

  <div class="i0">Gi’e fools their silks, and knaves their wine,</div>
  <div class="i2">A man’s a man for a’ that.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>And, for myself, I cared for none of these things,
and no doubt Charley McKeand&mdash;&#8203;whose outspoken
comments on men and manners were the joy of the
circuit&mdash;&#8203;was fully within the truth when he insisted,
as he always did, that I was the worst-dressed man
on the circuit.</p>

<p>But truth compels me to say that my memory of
the first aspect of Manchester was a scene of hustle,
roughness, and uncouthness rather depressing to a
stranger in a strange land not to the manner born.
I discovered before long the kindness of heart and
the real sense of independence that underlies and is
the origin of the Manchester manner, but I still
think that there are many natives who mistake
incivility for independence, thereby lowering their
fellow-citizens in the esteem of mankind.</p>

<p><!--Page 076--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
I could quote many instances of what I mean,
but one will suffice. An eminent Withington
butcher, having delivered meat of exceptional toughness,
my wife remonstrated with him about it,
when he blurted out, “Nay, missis, it’s not my
meat&mdash;&#8203;if anything’s wrong, more laikely it’s your
teeth.”</p>

<p>It is this kind of greeting that puzzles the softer
races of the South.</p>

<p>And if there was one thing more than another
that impressed me as having the real spirit of
Manchester abiding within it, it was the lurry. I
use the word lurry with the true Manchester spelling
as though it were an English and not merely a
Manchester word. The lurry is symbolic of the city
and the dwellers within its walls. The lurry incarnate
in wood and iron is a cart or wagon, what you
will, a four-wheeled, oblong, flat tray, cumbersome
yet capable of bearing great burdens. There is a
stern largeness about its aspect, a straightness about
its course&mdash;&#8203;it is never at its ease in turning corners&mdash;&#8203;which
always suggests to me an ancient Roman
origin, though there is a noble catholicity about it
which is quite the reverse of Roman, for it will carry
anything for money. I have seen a two-horse lurry
marching slowly down Market Street bearing only
a solitary blue band-box. But its chief and usual
burden is a load of bales of cotton cloth. From the
upper windows of narrow streets heavy pieces of
cloth are flung accurately and rapidly on to the
lurry waiting below, and the driver, moving within
<!--Page 077--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
an ace of destruction on the floor of the lurry, stacks
them solidly together until the load is complete.
Then when the sun shines&mdash;&#8203;as it has been known to
on occasions even in Portland Street&mdash;&#8203;the lurry,
with its two magnificent horses, strolls proudly away
to station or steamer, no tarpaulin covering its
snowy burden&mdash;&#8203;the harvest of Lancashire&mdash;&#8203;and
when your stranger’s eyes follow it with admiration,
you begin to learn something of the spirit and
character of the city whose symbol it is. For the
lurry is a carrier of goods from man to man, a four-wheeled
middleman, moving in a straight, dogged,
obstinate course, shoving lighter affairs aside, disputing
its right to all the street even with its own
municipality and their trams, caring little who goes
down beneath its hoofs and wheels so long as the
cotton bales and pieces arrive and are sent forth,
and that the loads are pressed down and shaken
together and running over, and that business is
good.</p>

<p>And the lurry horses, like the Sunday School
children, have their feast day also, which is the
first of May, when, bedecked with ribbons and
caparisoned in gleaming harness, they parade the
streets. Who that has seen them will ever forget
the splendid teams of Robert Clay, the bleacher, as
they swing round into Albert Square on a sunny
first of May and gladden the hearts of Manchester
man, woman and child, with a vision of strength and
wealth and beauty and business?</p>

<p>For the first idea of Manchester is business, and the
<!--Page 078--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
second idea of Manchester is business, and the seventy
times seventh idea of Manchester is business, and the
outward and visible sign of the Manchester idea is a
lurry laden with cotton cloth. And had I had a
hand in the emblazoning of a coat of arms, instead
of a beehive&mdash;&#8203;whose denizens are, after all, but a dull
set of socialist fellows, fond of rural pursuits and
little embued with the Manchester ideals&mdash;&#8203;I would
have set aside that <em>terrestrial globe semée of bees volant
on a wreath of the colours</em>, and instituted a lurry&mdash;&#8203;not
<em>rampant</em> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courant</i>, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passant</i>&mdash;&#8203;day and night
constantly and eternally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passant</i>, until the last
Manchester contract is fulfilled and the last load of
cotton goods is delivered.</p>

<p>I do not say I learned all this about Manchester in
one Whit-week. On the contrary, it took me a
quarter of a century to find out what little I have
learned, and even now I recognise that I am only
outside the veil of a great mystery. For the heart
and life and being of Manchester and its surroundings
is a human study worthy of a sane and honest
philosopher, if such a one exist, and I am only
attempting to set down a few traveller’s notes, as it
were.</p>

<p>Now, at first, no Courts were sitting, and I sat in
my chambers, which were up two flights of stairs in
41, John Dalton Street&mdash;&#8203;where I remained even in
the days of my prosperity&mdash;&#8203;and there I settled to
work on my edition of Dorothy Osborne’s letters,
and only heard the blurred rattle of the lurries over
the stone setts through the double windows which
<!--Page 079--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
all Manchester offices must have to preserve the
sense of hearing of their inmates.</p>

<p>And though I think it is a good thing for the
fledgling barrister to write a book of some sort, so
that he may have an occupation to keep him in his
chambers, and be there ready to greet that first great
cause which is going to bring him fame or fortune,
yet he should never miss a meet of the profession at
sessions or assizes, even though he is well aware he is
merely going to sit at the receipt of a custom that is
not there.</p>

<p>The Manchester Assize Courts, where most of our
local courts were held, are very handsome and convenient
buildings. Any other city but Manchester
would have approached them through something
better than a slum. But there is not a single entrance
into Manchester that can be described as either
comely or decent. The individual public buildings
of Manchester are, many of them, of exceptional
beauty. How fine the Town Hall would look&mdash;&#8203;if it
were washed! The streets of Manchester are by no
means badly cleansed. Why should Manchester
wash her feet and not wash her face? Why should
Manchester fail to appreciate what other cities of
Europe seem to understand, that you do not only
want fine buildings, but worthy roads and streets to
see them as you approach? It is the approach shot
that Manchester has to learn in architecture.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first walk down Strangeways
towards the Courts, and the despair that entered
into my soul as I thought of the Embankment
<!--Page 080--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
and my beloved Temple, with its pure fountain
and its memories of Tom Pinch and Ruth. How
dismally I compared these with the filthy, black,
oily river, the grimy cathedral, the ancient four-wheeled
cabs, and their miserable horses bending
their knees and drooping their heads as if in worship
of the graven image of Oliver Cromwell, and then a
plunge underneath clanging railway bridges and
along a mean Yiddish street, to encounter a glad
surprise when the glorious vista of the Law Courts
swam into my ken. As a practical joke upon the
stranger within your gates&mdash;&#8203;excellent! As a piece
of municipal town planning&mdash;&#8203;rotten!</p>

<p>But if I seem to dwell too much on the deficiencies
of Manchester as a great city, it is only because I am
trying to recall as honestly as I can the first impression
it made upon my little Cockney mind, for
to-day when I return to its flags and setts I pace
them with as much of the pride of a real citizen
as my modesty will allow. And though the outward
aspect of the streets was somewhat forbidding, the
kind-heartedness of the inhabitants was soon made
manifest. It was a wild venture I had made, but
I had one introduction that I presented without
delay, and that was addressed to Mr. C. P. Scott,
of the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>. Of all Manchester
people Mr. and Mrs. Scott had the true Manchester
instinct of hospitality. It did not matter that the
people introduced were young, unimportant and of
no account, that made it the more necessary to
entertain them and introduce them to others. It was
<!--Page 081--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
not many weeks therefore before dining at Mr. Scott’s
we met his chief assistant editor, W. T. Arnold.</p>

<p>The world knows Arnold as a writer and historian.
I can only speak of him as a kind friend and my
master in journalism. That I should ever have commenced
journalism at all in Manchester rested in
the main on one of those accidental foundations
upon which the world seems mainly to be built.</p>

<p>At that first dinner-party at Mr. Scott’s house my
wife went in with Mr. Arnold. I can remember the
occasion well because the whole idea of the gathering
was so new to me. For instance, in London if you
dined with a judge there were leaders of the Bar,
a dull stranger and two old solicitors who had
briefed the judge in earlier days. If you dined with
an artist there were patrons, and if possible a critic.
If you dined with a professor, it was all professors,
if with a doctor, all doctors. But here were barristers,
journalists, specialist doctors, members of Parliament
and merchants all round one table, and the talk
never degenerated into any one special “shop.”
Manchester is exactly the right size for a dinner-party,
and there are enough of all sorts and conditions
of workers in it to bring together a really interesting
company. Moreover Manchester knows how to
entertain. It happened, then, that my wife began
to talk to Mr. Arnold about the Seine. We had had
a very interesting trip up the river that summer
with an artist friend, taking over a half-outrigged
boat from Oxford, starting from Caudebec and
rowing up to Paris, camping out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>. Arnold
<!--Page 082--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
was enthusiastic about France and all things
French. Moreover he knew Les Andelys and Chateau
Gaillard and Pont de l’Arche. I think my wife
claimed that we were the first English folk to row up
the Seine, except, of course, Molloy and his four on
French rivers&mdash;&#8203;for had we not camped on the
Ile St. Georges below Rouen where they were
wrecked, and learned all about their adventures from
Madame, the grandmother of the farm.</p>

<p>But Arnold was sure that he had read something
recently about it&mdash;&#8203;he remembered he had cut it out&mdash;&#8203;it
was in the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>.</p>

<p>“That was our trip,” replied my wife.</p>

<p>Arnold bunched up his black eyebrows and had
a good look at me across the table. After dinner
he said in that off-hand, desultory way that hindered
him getting to the hearts of some Manchester men&mdash;&#8203;Oxford
has its drawbacks, after all<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Do you care to write for the <cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite> occasionally?”</p>

<p>Did I care to write? What a question to ask a
young man with a wife and daughter and rent and
taxes and no hope of an old age pension.</p>

<p>The bargain was struck, and the next week I
commenced dramatic critic. Arnold approved, and
I remained.</p>

<p>I never caught the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite> manner,
and I know I was too enthusiastic and unacademic,
but I wrote on all sorts of subjects, and shall always
remember the kindness of Arnold, who was my
immediate chief, and all the staff, from the highest
<!--Page 083--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
to the lowest. Generally Arnold’s blue pencil was
rightly wielded, but now and again, of course,
enthusiasm scored.</p>

<p>I remember among a lot of books to review I had
singled out the “Auld Licht Idylls,” by J. M.
Barrie. I am glad to say for my reputation as a
reviewer that it captured me and I enthused. I
came into Arnold’s room in the office after the
theatre. I can see him now, sitting wearily in the
midst of proofs and papers. He looked up at me as
I entered with an amused smile&mdash;&#8203;he regarded me,
I think, as an irrepressible, journalistic infant.</p>

<p>“That Scots’ book, you know,” he said, pulling out
a proof&mdash;“Walter Scott and Bret Harte and Mark
Twain rolled into one. Really, Parry, when will
you grow up?”</p>

<p>I defended my point of view earnestly, and after
listening a while he shrugged his shoulders, saying,
“Good night; it’s not badly written&mdash;&#8203;except for the
adjectives. I’ll see to it.” He did see to it&mdash;&#8203;with
the blue pencil. For Arnold did not believe with
the moderns in discovering a new literary genius
once a week and canonizing him on the spot. He
was a high priest of letters, and his literary saints
had to be thoroughly tested in the pure fires of his
critical insight before they were consecrated. But
months afterwards he was just enough to say as I
brought him in a theatre notice, “By the way,
Parry, that Scots’ book. I’ve read it. We might
have left in all that about Mark Twain and Bret
Harte&mdash;&#8203;and even Scott. But mind you don’t do
<!--Page 084--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
it again; you won’t find another Barrie in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>I have not; nor indeed have I found another
Arnold, so patient, cynical, learned and full of
kindliness to those who worked under him. He
was indeed a great loss to Manchester and the
English Press. He too was, like myself, a stranger
within the gates. He came to Manchester in
1879 from Oxford, where I think he had been a
coach, and he had certainly brought from Oxford the
best she has to give. For nearly twenty years he
was a hard-working journalist, but he never lost his
love of scholarship, and he was a scholar without
pedantry. In his old-world house in Nelson Street,
the site of which is now, I think, covered by the
Infirmary buildings, he loved to greet newcomers
and cheer them on their path with good-humoured,
sane and helpful thoughts. He knew the best of
Manchester, for he, too, loved to explore on foot or
a wheel the moors and lanes and woodlands which lie
within such tempting adjacence to the city. “I see
him,” writes one who knew him best, “alert and
vigorous, his broad shoulders somewhat over-weighted
by the strong intellectual head, his dark
eyes full of fun and affection.” The picture is by
a great artist, and it cannot be bettered.</p>

<p>The stage lost a real friend in Arnold. His
criticisms were not the fretful, carping essays of the
moderns. He had the capacity to do common-place
work earnestly, and gave of his best to the task of
every day. Moreover, he loved good acting, and knew
<!--Page 085--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
it when he saw it, and was catholic in his tastes.
Like all men, he had his mannerisms. As he said of
himself, “It is the pedagogue in me which needs
subduing,” and in the main he kept it under. Yet
I think I could trace his unsigned writings in the
Press by his love of a French phrase. The French
were always with him, and in season and occasionally
out of season, like the great Mr. Wegg, he dropped
into French. Some of these adjectives were well
chosen. Thus Irving’s humour in the grave-digger’s
scene was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">macabre</i>; Pinero understood the use of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot de la situation</i>; and the English opinion of
the French classical writers was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sangrenu</i>&mdash;&#8203;I have
but a hazy notion of the meaning of the word, still it
sounds satisfying. These words are expressive, but
on occasion he would, to show he was a mortal
journalist, descend to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déclassé</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i> like
the lower infusoria of the reporter’s room.</p>

<p>I remember in his French enthusiasm he gave me
to read a criticism in a French paper&mdash;&#8203;by Sarcey, I
fancy. “Why cannot we do work like that? Why
can’t that be done in England?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think it might be,” I replied. “Indeed, under
proper conditions, I think I could do it myself. All
I should want is the same conditions as the French
fellow&mdash;&#8203;half the first sheet of the <cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite> once a week to print my criticisms on, and,
of course, Sarcey’s salary, and my name at the
bottom of the page.”</p>

<p>The ribaldry of demanding half the first page of
the <cite>Guardian</cite> for anything but advertisements was
<!--Page 086--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
too much for Arnold, and the gathering rebuke of
flippancy dissolved in laughter.</p>

<p>Arnold was disabled at forty-four and died in
1904, at the age of fifty-two. Bravely and unselfishly
he bore his weary years of sickness, using every
available hour for scholarship and study. I last saw
him in Manchester some time before his death. He
was then very weak and ill and in great pain; but
I remember this of it at least with pleasure, that when
I came to say farewell at his bedside the word he
whispered, at which I proudly caught, was “friend.”</p>

<p>And it was through the kindness of Mrs. Scott,
too, that Miss Gaskell and her sister became aware
of our existence and collected us into their fold, so
that whenever some actor or doctor or artist or
musician or writer or thinker came to Manchester
there was an invitation to meet him or her at their
historic house in Plymouth Grove. It is hard to say
whether these pleasant dinner-parties were more
refreshing to the body or the soul. One reads of the
Parisian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> of the reign of Louis XV., but one
cannot believe that the privilege of attending
Madame Geoffrin or Madame Necker could be compared
to the honour of an invitation to Plymouth
Grove. Art, literature, music, and drama were
impersonated by the greatest artists, though they
were not there as lions to gaze at, but rather as
friends of the home. The hospitality and elegance
of the entertainment would have been a happy
memory for Lord Guloseton himself, and as he came
away he would have sheathed his silver weapons
<!--Page 087--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
with content. Though these were things other
houses could give you, the real treasure casketed
in the shrine of Plymouth Grove was the homely
welcome which great and small received from the
high priestesses. It was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> of Louis XV.
conceived in the spirit of Cranford.</p>

<p>And if, as we are promised, there are to be many
mansions in the realms above, I trust it is not
impious to hope that one will be situated in some
Elysian Plymouth Grove, exact in every detail to
the dear original. For it must have the same semi-circular
drive approaching its old-fashioned portico,
and the steps must be a trifle steep by which you
reach the shuttered door, and I must be permitted to
be young again, unknown and obscure, and to drive
up in a heavenly hired four-wheeled cab, so that when
the door is opened by some neat angel maid-servant
I may feel fully again the honour that is done me.
Everything must be in its place in the beloved
drawing-room, for each book and picture, and piece
of furniture had its own welcome for you, and though,
of course, I should like to meet the shade of Charlotte
Brontë as well as some of those noted men and
women who were visitors in my day, yet all I shall
really wish for is the Manchester welcome the good
ladies gave me twenty-five years ago. For if
heaven is to be a success, there must be kind hostesses
to welcome shy, awkward, unknown, youthful
persons like myself, and make us at ease and at home
in the presence of the great ones. And though I
write this as a nonsense dream, I do it because I find
<!--Page 088--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
it easier to express truth in that form. And it is
certainly true that the good ladies of Plymouth
Grove made Manchester for me and mine as they did
for so many toilers of all degrees, a holier and better
place.</p>

<p>Falkner Blair was another kind friend who discovered
me when I first went to Manchester, and
helped by his kindly greeting to make its skies blue
for me and its sun to shine on me. He was the leader
among those juniors who practised mainly in the
Crown Court, and was afterwards a judge in India.
He and Arnold were good friends, though they had
little but Oxford in common&mdash;&#8203;Oxford has its
advantages&mdash;&#8203;and Blair called Arnold “the Don”
and Arnold nicknamed Blair “the Agreeable
Rattle.”</p>

<p>For I remember feeling very lonely wandering
about the Courts in those early days, when Falkner
Blair came up to me and said, “Is your name Parry?
Well, come up and take the dogs for a walk and have
some dinner.” It appeared I had met some relations
of his, but any pretext was good enough for Blair to
open his house to a newcomer and see what he was
like, and he was a real friend to his juniors.</p>

<p>Blair was a great character. He was a fine cross-examiner,
an eloquent speaker, and a better lawyer
than many supposed, but he was undoubtedly
indolent. Full of fads and enthusiasm, he was an
excellent talker, the remains of a classical billiard
player, a most redoubtable gourmet, and a great
lover of dogs. The three collies of those days,
<!--Page 089--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
Bruce, Vixen, and Luath, were well known in
the neighbourhood and greatly admired by the
“doggy.”</p>

<p>Blair had a ready wit. I remember him escorting
some ladies round the law courts during the luncheon
hour when they came across the antique spears of
the javelin men piled in a corner of the corridor outside
the judges’ room. “Whatever are those used
for?” asked a lady, gazing at them admiringly.</p>

<p>“Those, my dear madam,” said Blair with prompt
decision, “are used by the Judge in the Crown Court
when he charges the grand jury.”</p>

<p>The ladies looked at them with reverent awe and
shuddered.</p>

<p>Just as I was beginning to do a little work
I was invalided, and the doctor wanted me to go to
the Riviera in January. As I could afford neither
time nor money for this I decided on Barmouth. I
was very depressed about having to go away, and,
meeting Blair, told him my trouble. He was overjoyed.
There was nothing doing, and he and Mrs.
Blair and the dogs would join us. He would go
ahead and get rooms with his friend Mrs. Davis, at
the Cors-y-gedol. I wonder how many remember
that fine portrait of the dear old lady that her
son-in-law, Phil Morris, R.A., painted.</p>

<p>Blair in an hotel became a kind of proprietor of
it and chief guest rolled into one. The first night
we were nearly all awakened by a horrible noise of
clashing bells. It ought to have been a fire, but
nothing had happened, we were told. What really
<!--Page 090--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
occurred Blair explained at breakfast without a
notion that there was any reason for apology or
regret.</p>

<p>“I sat up till about half-past twelve, and
went up to bed and said, ‘Where’s Vixen?’”&mdash;&#8203;the
beloved dogs always slept with him. “There
was no Vixen. I went downstairs and looked
everywhere, and then heard poor Vixen whining
outside the front door. I tried to undo the chains
and things, but couldn’t manage it, and couldn’t
find a soul about, and there was the poor dog
whining outside. Luckily”&mdash;&#8203;what an adverb to
choose&mdash;“luckily I found a broom lying about, so
I just swept the row of bells in the passage backwards
and forwards until quite a lot of people came, and
we let the poor dog in.”</p>

<p>The late Bishop of St. Asaph, who had come for
the rest cure, left the next morning, but Mrs.
Davis only laughed. If Blair was in an hotel it
mattered not who came or went.</p>

<p>Blair was full of hygienic fads, and one of them
was a very huge sponge, which was placed on the
window-sill of his second floor bedroom, and much
admired by passers-by in the street. Blair would
discourse at length on the properties of the sponge,
and how it soaked in ozone all day and gave it forth
in the morning tub. One afternoon we were standing
at our sitting-room window, which was directly
beneath his bedroom, and Blair called our attention
to two little dogs having a tug-of-war in the street
with what looked like a long rope. Blair cheered
<!--Page 091--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
on the smaller dog, leaning out of the window and
shouting, “Go it, little ’un! Two to one on the
black one. Stick to it! Stick at it! Hurrah!
No! What! Good heavens! It’s my sponge.”
The next we saw was Blair with an umbrella
separating the combatants and swearing vigorously.
The hygienic properties of the rescued morsels were
never afterwards referred to.</p>

<p>I learned in that visit the wonderful qualities of
Welsh air. I came down scarcely able to walk from
the hotel to the station; I finished up in a fortnight
with more than a twenty-mile tramp. Blair was a
great hill walker, and knew Wales and the Lake
District in and out. The younger generation of
Manchester will find as they grow old that they have
lost many of the pleasures of memory which might
have been theirs, because they have spent their
holiday hours on crowded tees and in arid bunkers
when they might have been learning something of
what Coleridge meant when he wrote of</p>

<p class="p2">The quarter sessions courts are some of the oldest
criminal courts in the kingdom. Some time in the
reign of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> their quarterly sittings were
ordained by statute, but long before that they were
a general court of justices for the maintenance of
the peace, though not sitting quarterly. Henry V.
appointed them to sit in the first weeks after Michaelmas
Day, the Epiphany, Easter and the Translation
of St. Thomas à Becket, which is July 7. These
dates are but slightly modified by modern statute.</p>

<p>It is curious how through the ages the clever ones
of the world have gibed and jeered at justices and
justices’ justice. And yet at the bottom of the heart
of English folk there is a feeling of love for these old
institutions, and after all&mdash;&#8203;fair play to them&mdash;&#8203;they
work well and make no more blunders in the
administration of justice than any other courts, as
the statistics of Appeal Courts will testify. But
when you have on the bench a large number of
laymen, many invested with a power the attributes
<!--Page 093--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
of which they do not understand, you are bound
to get character and comedy, and that is what to my
mind attracted the writers of various ages to the
justice of the peace rather than any burning desire
for legal reform.</p>

<p>And well it is that it has been so, for otherwise we
should never have met Cousin Shallow&mdash;&#8203;Robert
Shallow, Esquire&mdash;“In the county of Gloster, justice
of peace and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coram</i>. Ay, cousin Slender and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cust-alorum</i>. Ay, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rato-lorum</i> too.” And these
allusions to-day only tickle the fancy of the antiquarians.
But on their own first night every
playgoer must have known the difference between a
mere justice, and one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quorum</i>, and knew too,
that the Custos Rotulorum was the principal civil
officer of the county. I wager the play opened with a
roar when Shallow stamped himself on his entrance
as an absurd boaster who did not even know the
titles of the dignities he claimed to have held. One
can forgive Fielding his laughable account of Squire
Western and his justiceship, which “was indeed a
syllable more than justice,” for Fielding was a
stipendiary magistrate, and I never met a stipendiary
who had not a low opinion of the lay justices,
the reason being, I suppose, as Montaigne tells us,
that “few men are admired by their servants.”
Dickens was a reporter, and no doubt had come
across the actual justice of the peace who sat for the
portrait of Mr. Nupkins, but I think he would have
agreed that Sam Weller’s judgment that “there
ain’t a magistrate goin’ as don’t commit himself
<!--Page 094--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
twice as often as he commits other people” is to be
taken in a Pickwickian sense. Lay justices no
doubt do commit themselves individually, but is this
not true even of justices of the King’s Bench Division?
For instance:&mdash;&#8203;But forbear! Who am I that I
should suddenly become presumptuous and self-willed
and begin to speak evil of dignitaries.</p>

<p>And looking back quite honestly at the work done
by justices at quarter and petty sessions, I think the
outcry that arises over individual instances of mistake,
though good as a tonic for the bench, is not a
fair thing if it is the only comment that fellow
citizens have to offer to the wide amount of useful
and honourable work that is done by the lay
magistracy.</p>

<p>But as a beginner at the Bar, I did not go to
quarter sessions to study the interesting social
problem of the value of a lay magistracy, but because
it was in these courts I first attained not only the
right of audience, but the thing itself. There were
many sessions to attend, the most important being
the sessions of the county holden at Lancaster,
Preston, Salford and Kirkdale. Then there were the
city sessions for Manchester and Liverpool, and
borough sessions at Wigan and Bolton, the last-named
being genially presided over by that good
friend of the circuit, Sam Pope, Q.C. Even if you
had no work when you got there, the jaunt into
new surroundings and the social meeting when you
arrived, and the feeling that after all you had a place
in the pageant of some kind, was a pleasant relief
<!--Page 095--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
from the dreariness of sitting in chambers. I
suppose the racehorse who walks in after the race is
over prefers being out on the heath to standing in
his stall all day, and so it is with a junior barrister
at quarter sessions. It is good to be in the race at
all. And then as now, and I suppose as always,
there was the same moaning about the want of work
and the overcrowded state of the profession. But
in the nature of things a profession, to be worth
anything at all, must be overcrowded, the struggle
for existence must be strenuously fought, many
must be called and few chosen or a high standard
of work will never be maintained.</p>

<p>There is no doubt at all that the most difficult
thing to do at the Bar is to begin. For years you go
round the links without a golf ball, as it were, unless
you have the luck to pick one up somewhere.
Gilbert’s classical receipt, namely, to fall in love with
the rich attorney’s elderly, ugly daughter, is scarcely
available to the married man.</p>

<p>I remember a disappointed cynic on the Northern
Circuit, watching a third-rate encounter between two
barristers of different religions, saying to me:
“Parry, if I had my time over again I should start
the Bar as a Jew or a Roman Catholic.” And
certainly if you look among the list of those who have
done well in the profession the members of these
bodies are not unnumbered among the upper dogs.</p>

<p>Another way to success is to start with plenty of
money. As Falkner Blair said of a wealthy young
junior, who was keen about getting work, “What a
<!--Page 096--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
pleasant thing it would be to have £5,000 a year to
buy briefs with&mdash;&#8203;only why not buy something
jollier?”</p>

<p>But money and friendly solicitors are not alone
sufficient. Indeed, I have known men who were
injured at the opening of their career by having
briefs thrust at them which they were not equipped
to deal with. Many of us, however, would have
taken that risk willingly, no doubt.</p>

<p>If, however, you know no solicitors and belong to
no community specially interested in your welfare,
and have no money, the only way is to show yourself
at quarter sessions in the hope that you may be
discovered by some enterprising solicitor.</p>

<p>The quarter sessions of the city of Manchester,
holden at Minshull Street, are run by the city
authorities. There is a list of the members of the
Bar present, and as counsel have the sole right of
audience, each prisoner has to be prosecuted by
counsel, and the minor cases are “souped” or given
out in rotation among the junior bar. After this
ceremony was over those of the juniors who had
drawn blanks made off to lunch at their clubs, and
were seen no more.</p>

<p>I found it sufficiently entertaining to sit in
court and listen to Blair and Shee, and Byrne
and McKeand, defending prisoners, and my first
glimpses of Manchester clubs were so pleasant that
I deliberately did not join any for some time, so that
I should not be tempted to be away from chambers
in working hours. There were generally two courts
<!--Page 097--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
at the Manchester Sessions, and it was not long
before I was asked by some of my seniors to hold
their briefs in one or another.</p>

<p>At that time our recorder was Henry Wyndham
West, Q.C. Manchester and West had very little in
common. He was a typical Whig aristocrat, born
and bred in London, impartial, honest, and fearless
in his administration of the law, but apparently
wanting in sympathy for, and certainly lacking in
knowledge of, the working class in the north of
England. It is said that in 1865, when he was
appointed to the Recordership, he startled a Manchester
jury by some strange comments on the
evidence as to the time of a theft. “Then, gentlemen,
we are told that this happened at the dinner-hour.
I think learned counsel for the Crown should
have asked the witness to state the time more
definitely, for, as we all know, the dinner-hour may
mean any time in the evening between 6.30
and 8.”</p>

<p>West, in his day, had had a great practice in the
Yorkshire West Riding Sessions in cases as to the
“settlement” of paupers, but these were all dead
and gone now, and, except in a few important
prosecutions, he did not do much work on circuit.
For some reason unknown, he and the late Lord
Coleridge did not love one another. Falkner Blair
used to tell a story of Lord Coleridge coming on
circuit in the early days and asking him about
West.</p>

<p>“I never see him at Westminster. What does he
<!--Page 098--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
do?” asked Lord Coleridge in his suavest and most
silvery tongue.</p>

<p>“He’s Recorder of Manchester,” replied Blair.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“And Attorney-General for the Duchy of
Lancaster.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!”</p>

<p>“And judge of the Salford Hundred Court of
Record.”</p>

<p>“Is he really?”</p>

<p>“And prosecuting counsel for the Post Office.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” said Coleridge, throwing up
his head in astonishment. “What a lot of outdoor
relief the fellow has!”</p>

<p>West, however, certainly had his revenge in a case
at Liverpool. He was defending some men for
assault upon a woman. The jury had disagreed at
Manchester, and Lord Coleridge, who was eager to
get a conviction&mdash;&#8203;probably for good reason&mdash;&#8203;tried
them again in Liverpool. Louis Aitken&mdash;&#8203;who held
a junior brief in the case with West&mdash;&#8203;used to give a
graphic account of the scene as one of the most
polished, yet deadly encounters he had ever
witnessed between Bench and Bar.</p>

<p>West had put up some men in the court, and
asked the woman questions about them. He did
not call the men as witnesses. After West had made
his speech to the jury, during which there had been
several skirmishes between Coleridge and himself,
the Lord Chief Justice began the summing-up and
West went out of court. The Chief commented
<!--Page 099--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
severely upon West omitting to call the men who had
been shown to the jury. Nash, one of West’s juniors,
jumped up to remonstrate, but Lord Coleridge
swept him aside. Aitken went out for West, who
returned and made an endeavour to interrupt the
judge, for which he was sternly rebuked, and the
summing-up continued to the end and the jury
retired. Then West, with aristocratic humility,
but in the tone of a schoolmaster who is going to
administer punishment at the end of the lecture,
began:</p>

<p>“My lord, I understand your lordship commented
unfavourably on my action in not calling as witnesses
the men who were put up in court for identification
by the prosecutrix.”</p>

<p>“I did, indeed, Mr. West,” replied Coleridge in
his silkiest manner. “Very unfavourably; indeed,
I regretted to feel compelled to make such strictures
on the conduct of counsel.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure your lordship would, and it is with
equal regret, and only because it is my duty to the
prisoners and your lordship, that I must call your
lordship’s attention to the case of the Queen against
Holmes, reported in 1871 in the first volume of
the Law Reports Crown Cases Reserved, at page
334. This case overruled the case of the Queen
against Robinson, which doubtless your lordship
remembers.”</p>

<p>“And what does the Queen against Holmes
decide, Mr. West?”</p>

<p>“It decides that such witnesses cannot be called,”
<!--Page 100--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
said West, handing up the volume with a grave bow.
“Your lordship will find that the Court of Crown
Cases Reserved had exactly the same point before
them, and overruled your lordship’s learned father
for the same error that your lordship has fallen into
this morning.”</p>

<p>Coleridge did not lose his head, but replied with a
charming bow and a sweet smile, “I am much
indebted to you, Mr. West.”</p>

<p>West bowed low, and the duel was over.</p>

<p>Coleridge had to send for the jury and tell them
his mistake, which he did, of course, amply and
thoroughly, and the men were acquitted.</p>

<p>To my thinking West was a valuable asset to
Manchester citizens, and they should have accounted
it a privilege to have the constant example of a
righteous aristocrat before them, if only to remind
them that the Manchester ideal of men and manners
is not the only ideal in the world. In nothing did
these two ideals clash with greater sound and fury
than in relation to commission cases, many of which
came before the Court of Record. The commission
sought to be recovered in that court was generally
about as mean and low a commercial transaction as
could be well imagined. On the sale of the goodwill
of a public-house or a business some tout would
get hold of seller or buyer, and if he refused to be
squeezed into paying a commission there would be a
speculative action.</p>

<p>In one of these cases relating to a public-house
I was addressing the jury, and our best point, I
<!--Page 101--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
remember, was that up to now no one had paid a
commission of any kind, and therefore it was very
reasonable my client should have one. I was
expatiating on this when West interrupted in his
biting way:</p>

<p>“Is it a crime in Manchester to sell a public-house
without paying a commission?”</p>

<p>“Not a crime,” I replied, “but exceedingly bad
taste.”</p>

<p>The Manchester jury nodded approval.</p>

<p>After I had won the case West and I walked up
Strangeways together. He never wore a greatcoat,
and in the summer sported a white hat. I can see
his upright figure striding along with hands behind
his back and hear the comedy of indignation in his
voice as he turns round to me and says, “I tell you
what it is, Parry. If a Manchester man sold his
soul to the devil, some fellow-citizens would sue his
executors for a commission on the transaction.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” I replied, “and, after all, there are
several members of the Northern Circuit we could
spare to go down and take the evidence.”</p>

<p>But one would give a wrong impression of West if
one left it to be understood that he was an indifferent
judge. He was most earnest and painstaking in the
discharge of his duties, and though he never sought
to gain popularity by sentimentalism, he was very
ready if he felt he could honestly do so to extend
clemency to youths and first offenders and to the
weak who had fallen through temptation. The
heavy sentences he gave to the “scuttlers”&mdash;&#8203;gangs
<!--Page 102--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
of young hooligans who used to terrorise the back
streets&mdash;&#8203;were the subject of much comment. But
they stamped out the disease, at all events temporarily,
and left the ground clear for the more
permanent cures of social reformers. The scuttler
of the eighties finds a more wholesome outlet for his
energy to-day in the boxing competitions at the
lads’ club or in the battalions of the Boy Scouts.
On all occasions where West had to deal with
questions having a moral and social as well as a
legal aspect, his judgments were always healthy in
tone and liberal and enlightened in policy. I
remember well in a prize-fighting prosecution how
clearly and wisely he drew the distinction, difficult
to define in legal language, but easily understood in
the common-sense light he threw upon it, between
boxing as a wholesome and desirable sport or pastime,
and prize fighting as a brutal and degrading
spectacle or entertainment.</p>

<p>In all affairs that came before him he expressed
the views of a moderate, sensible English gentleman
who brought sound instincts of right and wrong to
bear upon his interpretations of the law. Those
who knew him personally will long remember the
charm of his somewhat old-world courtesy, and recall
with pleasure the wealth of his reminiscences and
anecdotes of early Victorian years. And now he is
gone we may openly remember his charitable deeds.
Harsh and stern as he was generally accounted,
some of us could have told of cases where he had
personally assisted the relatives of those whom in the
<!--Page 103--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
course of his duty he had been obliged to sentence to
imprisonment. But had one written of these things
in his lifetime, one would have forfeited his friendship,
so careful was he to hide his good works before
men and to leave his left hand in ignorance of the
doings of the right. To those who knew the man as
well as the judge, he will always remain an example
of the aristocrat at his best.</p>

<p>The quarter sessions of the county, holden at
Preston and at Salford, were, when I first went to
Manchester, very thriving and busy institutions.
They were both presided over by William Housman
Higgin, Q.C., a Lancashire worthy of an old-fashioned
type. He took great pride in the orderly administration
of justice at his sessions, and conceived
the Lancashire county justices to be ideal managers
of county affairs. It was, indeed, generally admitted
by the enemies of the system that Lancashire
gained very little from the practical point of view
by the institution of a county council, so excellently
had the magistrates done their work. It grieved
Higgin as years went on to see the new borough
sessions of Oldham, Salford, Blackburn, and Burnley
carved out of his district and diminishing the
prestige of his most ancient jurisdiction, and he
argued from a public point of view that as the leaders
of the junior bar could not attend at these minor
sessions, the work would never be done with its old
efficiency. Be this as it may, it is certain that there
is to-day no school of advocacy comparable to
Higgin’s quarter sessions when they were led by
<!--Page 104--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
Shee, Falkner Blair, and Charlie McKeand in the
criminal cases, and Sutton, Bradbury, and Yates in
the rating and licensing appeals.</p>

<p>Higgin wore a beard, and his movements were
greatly impeded by gout. There was, perhaps,
no great outward appearance of dignity in his presence,
but, sitting in court when he was on the
bench, I always felt that I could realise the phrase
“the majesty of the law.” Everything, however
trivial, was conducted in the grand manner, and if
Higgin was not without humour outside the court,
within its walls he did not allow this to escape even
by the twinkle of an eye.</p>

<p>I remember at Preston a little juryman of a fussy
nature claiming to affirm instead of taking an oath.
The matter was referred to Higgin, who bowed
gravely and said, “By all means, let the gentleman
affirm.”</p>

<p>This did not satisfy the little juror, who, with
impudent insistence, called out in a shrill voice,
“But I claim a right to affirm. I claim it as of
right.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Higgin, suavely, looking down on the
unfortunate little man as a dignified cat might look
at a mouse. “Oh! you claim it as of right. And
on what ground, may I ask?”</p>

<p>The little juror flushed with pleasure. Higgin was
giving him the opportunity he had been looking
for.</p>

<p>“Because I am an atheist,” he blurted out: “I
do not believe in a God.”</p>

<p><!--Page 105--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
Higgin gave him a withering look and waved him
out of the box with his gouty hand, and another
juror was chosen and sworn. Even then, outraged
as Higgin’s feelings were, I think nothing would have
happened, but the pertinacious juror jumped up and
said, “I suppose I may go.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Higgin’s patience, and with
all the solemnity at his command Higgin delivered
the following sentence: “No, sir, you may not go.
You are summoned here as a citizen to take part in
these proceedings as a juror. If I am to believe
your word&mdash;&#8203;and, unfortunately, I see no reason to
doubt it&mdash;&#8203;the oath that has been offered to you
would not be binding on your conscience, and there
is no law enabling you to qualify yourself for your
duties. At the same time, you have been rightly
summoned here, and it is your duty to be present
from the sitting of the court at nine-thirty until the
court rises for the day. Go into yonder gallery,”
continued Higgin, pointing up to a solitary
gallery opposite the bench, “and continue there,
under pain of fine and imprisonment, until the
sessions are concluded, from which place it will be
your privilege to watch the proceedings of twelve
honest Englishmen who do believe in God.”</p>

<p>I think at the end of the harangue, so impressively
did Higgin deliver it, that the juror expected to
hear that he was “to be hanged by the neck until
he was dead.” He slunk away to his lonely gallery,
and Higgin never failed to make him a special bow
of recognition every time he entered the court.</p>

<p><!--Page 106--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
The sentences given by Higgin seemed to me
terrible and almost brutal, but, as a matter of fact,
the class of criminal dealt with is a very difficult
proposition. Parliament provides no other way of
keeping him out of mischief than penal servitude.
If he is constantly in and out of prison he is a source
of anxiety and wretchedness to his family and a
dangerous nuisance to the public. Higgin’s view
was that when a man insisted on living by theft,
society ought to keep him out of mischief, and,
though it is a rough and perhaps cruel method of
doing it, the sentimentalist would probably be better
employed in instituting some kinder form of asylum
for the hopeless cases than in vainly clamouring for
their release from prison. There is at least as much to
be said for the judge who put the Dartmoor shepherd
in prison as for the statesman who let him out.</p>

<p>Higgin had a very considerable practice in
arbitrations, both as counsel and umpire or referee.
He was popularly said to have killed the arbitration
system in Lancashire by the length of the arbitrations
and the height of his fees.</p>

<p>Certainly the old days of fat arbitrations, with
short hours and long lunches, did not survive into
my time, though I was engaged in one or two
important arbitrations which I thought were fought
out with businesslike dispatch. Indeed, I think a
good arbitration is the very best tribunal for a
business dispute, always assuming that it is the
interest of everyone connected with it to get it
done at reasonable speed.</p>

<p><!--Page 107--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
In Higgin’s day, alas! it was otherwise. I
remember a good story Gully once told me of
a Manchester arbitration. Two business men,
brothers and partners, had very serious disputes, and
agreed to dissolve partnership. Under their deeds
of partnership the dispute had to go to arbitration.
Arbitrators were chosen on each side and Higgin
was appointed umpire. The tribunal sat at the
Mitre, a favourite home of Higgin, and on the first
day of the case Gully appeared for the defendant and
Leresche&mdash;&#8203;afterwards County Stipendiary&mdash;&#8203;for the
plaintiff. Neither brother had spoken to the other
for many weeks, and the whole dispute was rather a
painful one. About 11 o’clock Higgin arrived,
and having greeted everyone with friendly but dilatory
courtesy, opened a few letters which his clerk
had brought, and replied to them after obtaining
leave of counsel to do so.</p>

<p>Mine host then brought in the menu, and general
consultation as to lunch took place. The hour was
fixed at 1.30, the hot-pot ordered, and the
brand of wine decided upon. The two brothers
glared at each other during these strange proceedings
with the uneasy feeling that this was to be a funeral
feast and they were the corpse. To their rough
Lancashire minds it had somewhat that appearance.
And now it was nearing 12, and Leresche proceeded
to open the case. Leresche was not a man
of few words at any time, and his methods of obtaining
full value out of an arbitration were expensive
and peculiar. He started off by reading some
<!--Page 108--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
Scots deeds. They were deeds, he said, referred to
in the partnership deed, and were deeds of trust
and settlements and wills showing for some generations
where the partnership moneys had come from.
Gully protested that these were not relevant, but
Higgin gravely shook his head and said he never interfered
with counsel in his opening, and away sped
Leresche through a bewildering maze of incomprehensible
Scots law, continuing each deed to the end
of its jargon, and then folding it up and placing
it reverently in the middle of the table in front
of Higgin. There was a leisurely and social lunch,
all enjoying themselves except the two brothers, who
sat silent in sulky gloom. Leresche, duly refreshed,
went at the deeds again until about half-past three,
when he suggested an adjournment.</p>

<p>“For now,” he said, putting his hand on the
goodly pile before him, “I have read every deed,
and, subject to what you may say, sir, and what
my friend, Mr. Gully, may have to say, I really
cannot, for my part, see why it should be necessary
during the course of the arbitration to refer to these
deeds again.”</p>

<p>“I cannot see how it would assist us,” said Higgin,
gravely, “unless Mr. Gully&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gully assured him he never wanted to see or hear
of the deeds again.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, Mr. Leresche, about to-morrow?
Eleven o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Leresche, “and then I hope
to begin to open the business part of my case.”</p>

<p><!--Page 109--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
“By all means,” said Higgin, “eleven o’clock,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>As the two brothers were going downstairs the
elder tapped the junior on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come and have a whisky with me, Donald.”</p>

<p>“I will, Ronald.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Donald. We’re being
had on a bit here.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking the same, Ronald.”</p>

<p>They retired into the snug bar, and spent a
friendly hour together. The next morning at eleven
all met except Ronald and Donald. Their solicitors
with blank faces produced letters from their clients
that the litigation was over, and would they each
send in their bills.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Higgin, smiling pleasantly at the
disconsolate Leresche. “To hear you read those
Scots deeds would take the fight out of the most
litigious. I ought to have stopped you. But, never
mind, we have one consolation. Blessed are the
peacemakers.”</p>

<p>And though both West the aristocrat and the
Whig and Higgin the stern, unbending Tory were
both sound judges, kind-hearted men and honest,
upright, conscientious administrators of the law,
yet it is easy to see that their usefulness was limited
by their education and environment, and that it
would be untruthful to deny that in all human
beings&mdash;&#8203;in judges no less than in smaller men&mdash;&#8203;there
is a class bias drawing their minds to certain
conclusions and points of view. And no one can
<!--Page 110--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
certainly blame those whose bringing up has
been less fortunate and whose University has
been the factory or the pit, from recognising
very clearly that the judicial mind does not
readily coincide with the views and thoughts
and aspirations of their own class. And this
must remain so as long as the official places in
the law are the appanage of the upper and middle
classes.</p>

<p>I have often wondered why more of the clever
younger men of the working class do not grapple
with the study of the law. A few years ago I
addressed a labour audience in Manchester on
this subject and listened to an interesting firsthand
discussion of the matter. Although not
expressed in so many words, I think there
was an idea at the back of many speakers’
minds that an individual selected to be educated
and equipped for the profession would in the
end break away from service to his order and
seek to make good a great individual career.
But I am not sure that this would of necessity
be the case. I cannot imagine, for instance, that
Charles Bradlaugh if he had been at the Bar
would have utilised his sound and ingenious legal
mind merely in the making of money. And
the experiment should certainly be tried in the
interests of the whole community, for the Labour
Party will never be able to express its thoughts
articulately and clearly until it has its own
Attorney-General who can advise its Cabinet on
<!--Page 111--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
the legal aspects of the measures they have to
consider.</p>

<p>And one reason why I should not like to see the
ancient lay office of Justice of the Peace abolished
is because there and there alone men of the working
class are brought on to the bench as actual ministers
of the law. No doubt as time goes on and education
advances we shall find the circle widening out.
There should be far more working men sitting on
juries, and paid for their services, there should
be more representatives of all branches of trades
and industries sitting on the bench and taking
part in quarter sessions, and the amalgamation
of both branches of the profession would, I
feel sure, lead to less class origin in judicial
appointments.</p>

<p>But looking at the administration of the law in
this country in comparison with others, I cannot
but think that the court of quarter sessions&mdash;&#8203;especially
the larger county sessions, where the lay
element is strongly represented upon the bench&mdash;&#8203;is
a court wherein an innocent man desiring an honest
verdict may take his trial with a real sense of
security. And though no sane and reasonable
citizen doubts the honest administration of the
law in our country, yet perhaps words have fallen
of late years from the lips of those in high places
not unnaturally misunderstood in the lower places
where they fell. For there are judges who make
little effort to put themselves in the place of the poor
folk whose affairs they are dealing with, and forget
<!--Page 112--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
to obey the fifth law of Nature according to the
statute of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury. And
“the fifth law of Nature is Compleasance; that
is to say, that every man strive to accommodate
himself to the rest.” Or as St. Paul wrote to the
Galatians&mdash;&#8203;but you remember that.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CHAPTER <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">THE SENTENCE OF DEATH</h4>

<p class="small">The more attention one gives to the punishment of death, the
more he will be inclined to adopt the opinion of Beccaria&mdash;&#8203;that
it might be disused.</p>

<p class="flushright p1 small"><span class="sc">Jeremy Bentham</span>: “Theory of Legislation.”</p>

<p class="p2">I have long gone about with a conviction that
Sir Henry Wotton was right when he said that
“hanging was the worst use man could be put to.”
Not that I think he ever thrashed out the pros and
cons of the matter in his mind, but being, as Dr. Ward
says, a man of noble purposes and high thoughts,
whose qualities united into “the amalgam of a true
English gentleman,” he knew instinctively that the
thing was repellent to his nature, and therefore it
followed that it was economically unsound and
morally wrong. Being a courtier, he pretended that
the sentiment was that of the Duke of Buckingham,
and being a man of humour he invested his Grace’s
thought in an epigram. And for my part, though
the judgment is some three hundred years old it is
the last word on the subject. Dr. Johnson, who,
whatever greater qualities he possessed, was not a
gentleman&mdash;&#8203;or to be more accurate, perhaps, was on
occasion “no gentleman”&mdash;&#8203;was wont to express
<!--Page 114--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
himself wittily on the subject of hanging, for, as he
said, “Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is
to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind
wonderfully.” In like manner, in the true conservative
spirit, he inveighed against the abolition
of the good old days of Tyburn. “The age is
running mad after innovation; all the business of
the world is to be done in a new way; Tyburn itself
is not safe from the fury of innovation. No, Sir,
(said he eagerly,) it is <em>not</em> an improvement: they
object that the old method drew together a number
of spectators. Sir, executions are intended to draw
spectators. If they do not draw spectators they
don’t answer their purpose. The old method was
most satisfactory to all parties; the publick was
gratified by a procession; the criminal was supported
by it. Why is all this to be swept away?”</p>

<p>Of course the old fellow was only pulling young
Boswell’s leg. These were not his real opinions at
all. Thanks to Dr. Birkbeck Hill, one can always
study the varying philosophy of Dr. Johnson with
his pen in his hand, and Dr. Johnson with his tongue
in his cheek.</p>

<p>Johnson, the man of letters, “the strong and noble
man” in an essay in the <cite>Rambler</cite>, gives us his real,
earnest, sincere thoughts on the sentence of death.
“It may be observed that all but murderers have, at
their last hour, the common sensations of mankind
pleading in their favour. They who would rejoice at
the correction of a thief are shocked at the thought
of destroying him. His crime shrinks to nothing
<!--Page 115--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
compared with his misery, and severity defeats itself
by exciting pity.”</p>

<p>In that last phrase it seems to me that the great
man puts his finger upon the real objections to the
death sentence from the public point of view. The
pity that should be bestowed upon the victim is
poured out in muddy sentimentalism at the foot of
the scaffold. The sentence of death, “of dreadful
things the most dreadful,” surrounds its victim with
a halo in the morbid, popular mind that blacks out
the sense of the crime and cruelty for which the
murderer is to be punished.</p>

<p>It is curious how little interest is taken in the
subject of the death sentence to-day. On many a
question of sociology the best that has yet been said
has been said many generations ago. When Cesare
Bonesana Marchese di Beccaria published his “Dei
Delitti e delle Pene” in 1764 the world was thirsting
to read what was to be said scientifically
about crime and punishment, and the book actually
caused the abolition of many death sentences
in several European countries. For a book to
cause any reform whatever sounds to-day like
a miracle.</p>

<p>And, indeed, it almost seems as though since
the eighteenth century the pendulum has swung
back again towards the Old Testament view of
things. In this matter of capital punishment the
modern authorities are more disciples of Moses than
of the Apostles. They cry out, “Eye for eye,
burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for
<!--Page 116--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
stripe;” yet the student of Asiatic folk-lore might
well remember that Cain was not sentenced to death,
but, on the contrary, was purposely protected from
execution.</p>

<p>That the death sentence is a deterrent is commonly
said, yet the evidence seems to me unconvincing.
The fear of death is a weakness; but, in fact, death
is not a subject widely thought of. A murderer no
more contemplates death on the scaffold than he
thinks of any other form of death. As to the disgrace
of such an end, that is more than compensated
for by the opportunity of bravery and display so
dear to criminal conceit. No sooner is a man condemned
to death than the whole attitude of the
official mind changes towards him. He is treated
with exceptional humanity. His gaoler becomes
full of charity towards him. The clergyman assures
him of divine forgiveness. He dies in the odour of
sanctity, with pious sentiments upon his lips. Time
is not perhaps necessary to repentance, but surely as
a test of repentance, time is of the essence.</p>

<p>That there is a real human sentiment against
hanging comes out, I think, in the odium and horror
with which the actual hangman is regarded. Mr. Marwood,
of Horncastle&mdash;&#8203;from whom as a boy I used to
buy shoe laces, which were regarded with religious
awe by my class mates&mdash;&#8203;felt this very deeply. He
was an amiable, kindly man, as I remember. Indeed,
why there should be any special prejudice against a
hangman if his office is so necessary and worthy, it is
hard to understand. The race is a tender-hearted
<!--Page 117--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
one, if records may be believed. Mr. James Berry,
to whom Mr. Marwood handed over his rope and
pinions, tells us in that naïve and excellent autobiography
of his “Experiences of an Executioner,”
that before his first execution, when his dinner
arrived consisting of “rice pudding, black currants,
chicken, vegetables, potatoes, bread and the usual
teetotal beverages, I tried to make the best of it,
but all that I could do was to look at it, as my
appetite was gone.” Is not that even more convincing
than all the philosophy of Beccaria? The
prisoner eats a good breakfast, the hangman starves,
the prisoner in the dock is calm and reasonable, the
judge breaks down and weeps. What mean these
portents?</p>

<p>Some day it will dawn on rulers that it is not a
wise example to the mind of murderous tendency to
deliberately do the very thing which the State professes
to regard with feelings of grief and indignation.
When a low-class ruffian runs amuck, shouting
“I’ll swing for you!” and murders his victim, he is
proving the corollary of the Mosaic proposition. If
the law is to be a life for a life, it is fair for him to take
a life when he is ready to give his own in exchange.
It is rough, brutal logic, but not wholly fallacious.</p>

<p>And what will bring governments to a really
grave consideration of the subject is the increasing
difficulty in obtaining a conviction for murder, and
the still greater difficulty in carrying out the sentence
afterwards. In the Habron case the sentimental
public was right and officialdom wrong, and the
<!--Page 118--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
former saved a life. Since then the sentimentalists
back their opinion against officialdom on every sentence
that is pronounced. Scarcely any murderer
outrages the public mind so greatly but petitions are
widely signed by the hysterical against the fulfilment
of the law. True we have abolished Tyburn and the
bellman of St. Sepulchre’s, and the apples and
ginger-bread and the fighting and bawling and gin
drinking. No longer does Lord Tom Noddy invite
his friends to supper at the Magpie and Stump “to
see a man swing at the end of a string” in the
morning sunrise. But have we not something of
the same degradation in the highly spiced, detailed
accounts of every moment of a murderer’s life from the
day of the crime, through the excitement of the chase,
up to the dramatic capture, and then along the close
verbatim of the evidence until we reach the grand
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> of the sentence of death. Some there
are still faithful to eighteenth-century tradition,
huddling in the cold streets round the gaol gates to
watch the gaoler put up a notice of the end, for the
old black flag dear to this little band of stalwarts has
been hauled down, alas! for the last time. Of all the
blessings of the Education Acts none is taken greater
advantage of, I should say, than the privilege of
reading the diligent and accurate reports of murder
trials in the Press of to-day. Personally, I prefer the
ballads and broadsides and last dying speeches and
confessions of the older race of criminals, but some of
the picturesque articles of the imaginative&mdash;&#8203;or, as he
prefers to be called, descriptive&mdash;&#8203;reporter of the more
<!--Page 119--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
saffron-coloured Press have the true eighteenth-century
brush-mark, and I confess that they give me
a momentary second-hand thrill of horror quite
acceptable to my coarser nature. I do not wish to
do these excellent writers any injury, but I am
steadily hardening in the opinion that they are the
only persons in the community who derive any
benefit whatever from the death sentence, and we
must really run the risk of injuring their livelihood.</p>

<p>Personally, I never sat through murder trials
unless I had a business interest in them, nor to me
are they&mdash;&#8203;merely as trials&mdash;&#8203;of greater interest than
many other trials. But the overhanging sentence of
death gives them a colour that stamps them very
vividly in the memory.</p>

<p>What a curious drab, unentertaining drama was
that of Mrs. Britland, but for the sentence of death
at the fall of the curtain.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps if Dumas had had the handling of this
chapter he would have spun you a wonderful and
mysterious story out of the web of it. Though I
doubt after all if he would have deigned to write
about such a humble practitioner in the art of
poisoning. He must have his most noble Marquise
de Brinvilliers and her elegant accomplice, Sainte
Croix, before he can transpose squalid crime into
profitable romance.</p>

<p>Mary Ann Britland is a figure in Manchester
history as being the only woman ever hanged for
murder in Strangeways Gaol. For myself, I think
that nothing could have saved her from the ultimate
<!--Page 120--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
penalty of the law, though I recognise that there are
distinctions even among evildoers, and that there
was sense in the “bull” of the Irish barrister when
he was asked his opinion about the Maybrick case,
and said: “After all, you can’t expect an English
Home Secretary to hang a lady he might meet out at
dinner afterwards.” The trial was interesting to me
as being the first murder trial I had ever sat through,
and the closing scenes of it, horrible as they were,
impressed me very strongly with the inadvisability
of a Crown Court sitting late into the night on the
trial of prisoners, and went far to convince me that
capital punishment enshrined the wickedest criminal
in a veil of mystery behind which the crime itself and
its victims were too often lost sight of.</p>

<p>Mary Ann Britland was a factory operative about
thirty-nine years old, living with her husband and
daughter in Turner Lane, Ashton. On March 9, 1896,
her daughter died very suddenly. On May 3 her
husband died equally suddenly. She then went to
live with some neighbours named Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.
She and Mr. Dixon had been on very friendly terms,
and the evidence showed that Mary Dixon, her
friend’s wife, invited her to her house out of compassion.
On May 14 Mary Dixon died very
suddenly. Upon this the Ashton police began to
bestir themselves. A post-mortem was held on
Mary Dixon, revealing the fact that she died of
strychnine poisoning. Mrs. Britland was arrested.
The bodies of her daughter and husband were
exhumed, and the evidence showed that they, too,
<!--Page 121--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
had died of strychnine poisoning. Thomas Dixon
was now arrested, and an inquiry begun before the
magistrates. Falkner Blair defended the woman,
and Byrne appeared for Dixon. There was little or
no evidence against the latter, and an eloquent
speech by Byrne secured his discharge before the
magistrates. Although no doubt he was innocent,
it was to this piece of advocacy he probably
owed his life, as unless a judge on the trial had
withdrawn his case from the jury on the ground
that there was no evidence against him it is
almost certain he would have been convicted, so
hopeless is the position of a man whose only apology
is that the woman tempted him and he fell, when
he comes before a tribunal of twelve fellow-sinners.
Dixon’s only chance would have been a jury of
women.</p>

<p>The trial came before Mr. Justice Cave in July of
the same year. Addison, Q.C., and Woodard prosecuted,
and Blair and Byrne defended. I had
made a précis of the case for Blair at his request,
and I took a note for them during the trial. The
case lasted two days, and at the end of the second
day Blair addressed the jury. The evidence was
overwhelming. The three deceased persons had
been poisoned by strychnine. Mrs. Britland had
purchased “mouse powder” in sufficient quantities
to kill them all, and there was no evidence of any
mice on whom it could have been legitimately
used. The case of the poisoning of Mrs. Dixon was
the one actually tried, but the deaths of the others
<!--Page 122--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
were proved to show “system” and rebut the defence
of accident. Even if there had not been
sufficient evidence to secure a conviction, Mrs.
Britland had had many indiscreet conversations
about “mouse powder” and poisoning, and had been
anxious to discover whether such poisoning could be
traced after death. Blair’s task seemed hopeless
enough, but he made an eloquent and cunning
address to the jury.</p>

<p>It was one of those cases where anything like
reasoned argument would have been useless. The
only chance for the advocate who loved his art as
Blair did was to endeavour to instil doubt into
the receptive minds of the jury, that by good hap
the prisoner should gain the benefit of it. This he
did with great skill, touching lightly upon the
possibilities of accident or of poisoning by some
other hands, or even of self-administration. And
in those days when the guilty one was safe in the
dock and could give no evidence, there was greater
scope for the art of advocacy&mdash;&#8203;for is it not an art,
as Master Izaak tells us, to “deceive a trout with an
artificial fly.” And Blair was a great artist at the
raising of haunting doubts, which followed the jury
when they retired to their inner room, so that he
almost seemed to be the thirteenth man on the
jury, he and his doubts remained so present to their
anxious minds. And I remember no advocate who
could handle a hopeless case more cleverly within the
honest rules of the game, unless it be Sir Edward
Clarke himself. The result was extraordinary.
<!--Page 123--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
Mr. Justice Cave summed up in a businesslike and
sensible style, expecting a conviction in a few minutes,
and at twenty minutes to six the jury retired. The
judge waited some little time, but, as they did not
return, he went across to his lodgings, then in the
same building, and we went upstairs to the Bar
mess. At a quarter to eight they returned. The
wretched prisoner was put up in the dock. The
foreman explained that they were not agreed.
They handed a paper to the judge, who told them
to retire and consider the matter further.</p>

<p>Blair left the building and Byrne remained to see
what happened. It was well after 10 o’clock at
night before they returned into court. I suppose
the clerk of assize knew that they had not agreed
upon their verdict, and for humane reasons did
not send for the prisoner. Then began a conversation
between the judge and the foreman.
The judge told the jury that he must direct that
they be taken to the hotel for the night, and then
said, “Is there any legal difficulty in which I can
assist you?”</p>

<p>“Only the paper I gave you, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but is there any legal difficulty in your
way?”</p>

<p>To which the foreman replied, “Nothing, only
that you have there.”</p>

<p>Upon which the judge again told them he must
direct them to be taken to the hotel.</p>

<p>There was a pause. No one had any doubt what
the trouble of the jury was. They wanted in their
<!--Page 124--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
wrong-headed way to acquit Mrs. Britland because
they could not convict Mr. Dixon.</p>

<p>Cave thought for a moment, and then turning to
the jury made a short summing-up, tearing up any
shreds of evidence there might have been against
Dixon, and putting the case against Mrs. Britland
in true and convincing colours, winding up by
saying, “And now, gentlemen, you had better go
and consider it, and to-morrow morning I will hear
what you have to say.”</p>

<p>The jury held a brief consultation and begged a
quarter of an hour in which to escape the threatened
hotel. The judge granted this, and again the
jury retired.</p>

<p>I am far from saying that modern judges permit
wretches to hang that jurymen may dine, or that
they are actuated by any but business motives in
sitting late hours, but I have my doubts whether
justice is as well administered in the late hours of
the night as in more normal business hours, and it
is at least noticeable how this takes place more in the
provinces, where the judges live in lodgings, than in
London, where their lordships are in reach of their
clubs and their homes. I do not think the jury in
the Britland case would have agreed but for the
threat of the hotel made to them at 10 o’clock at
night, but it was certainly in mercy to the wretched
woman in the dock that the affair was ended, for
there were two other indictments for murder
hanging over her head.</p>

<p>I said the woman in the dock, but the late hours
<!--Page 125--><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
were, I fear, responsible for a very curious blunder
in procedure.</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Justice Cave was giving his last
instructions to the jury, of which Byrne and I took
notes, I added to my note, “During this direction
of the judge the prisoner was absent.” I called
Byrne’s attention to this fact, and he decided to
make a note of it and say nothing.</p>

<p>Blair afterwards considered that if he moved
for a writ of error the fact of the prisoner’s absence
might be held to invalidate the verdict, so jealously
is the right of a prisoner to be present during his
trial guarded by the English law.</p>

<p>Nothing was done in the matter because of the
two further indictments. Still, had the trial been
concluded in normal working hours, such a blunder
would not have been made by judge or clerk of
assize.</p>

<p>And now the jury return and answer to their
names. The gaslights flare up. Doors swing backwards
and forwards as counsel and officials come
hurrying into court. From behind the javelin men
crowds press eagerly forward at the back of the
court, and tired faces peer through the darkness
of the gallery, whence you hear murmurs and sighs
of relief that at last the moment waited for is at
hand. The wretched woman, tottering to the front
of the dock, is the colour of the parchment upon
which her crime is indicted. She is asked why
sentence should not be pronounced. She clings
to the rails and begins slowly and firmly, “I am
<!--Page 126--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
quite innocent. I am not guilty at all,” and then
breaks into piteous sobs and tears, and the female
warder holds her in position as if she were being
photographed. The judge’s clerk, who is stifling
a yawn, has placed the black cap on his master’s
wig. The judge in his nasal, solemn tones gets to
the sentence in as few personal words as may be.
The woman shrieks out “I never administered anything
at all to Mary Dixon! Nothing whatever!”
And when the judge reaches in resolute, mournful
syllables the formal death sentence, the human voice
that utters it seems to toll like a harsh metal bell
hopelessly and inevitably beating out the last
official message of the law: “And that is that you
be taken from here to the prison from whence you
came, that from thence you be taken to a place of
execution, and that there you be hanged by the
neck until you be dead, and that your body be buried
within the precincts of the prison&mdash;&mdash;” But the
final prayer that the Lord may have mercy on her
soul is lost in the wild, terror-stricken cries of the
woman for mercy as they unfasten her fingers from
the rails and carry her down the stairs towards the
gaol, and her shrieks and sobs come echoing out of the
stone passages below into the darkening court from
which her fellow-creatures are slinking away in horror.</p>

<p>The only other murder case in which I was engaged,
and in which the sentence of death was passed, was
in 1889&mdash;&#8203;a case in which I prosecuted as junior to
Falkner Blair&mdash;&#8203;and the facts remain vividly in my
memory.</p>

<p><!--Page 127--><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
Reg. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="versus">.v</abbr></i> Dukes, or the Bury murder, as it was
called, attracted widespread interest. Dukes was
manager of one of a series of furniture shops belonging
to the Gordon Furnishing Company, the central
shop of which was in Strangeways, Manchester.
The business was owned by an old man named
Gordon, who had two sons, Meyer and George. The
family were Jews. George Gordon visited the Bury
shop every Tuesday. There seems no doubt that
Dukes had been stealing the takings, and for a month
before the murder he kept on sending to Manchester
bogus letters and telegrams about business with the
intention of keeping George Gordon away from Bury.
For three or four Tuesdays he had not made his
usual visit, and when he did come on the morning of
Tuesday, September 24, Dukes was not there, but,
as we learned afterwards, was lying hid and drinking
in a neighbouring public-house. Gordon examined
the books and waited for Dukes, and then returned
to Manchester.</p>

<p>There he seemed to have consulted with his father,
and returned to Bury. Meanwhile, Dukes had
followed George Gordon to Manchester, called at the
central shop, and made a statement that he had been
in Manchester on business all day, that he was
returning to Bury, and would take a message from
the father, which he did. At Bury he now met
George Gordon. The shopboy was sent off by Dukes
with some furniture to an address that proved to be
an empty house. When he left with the cart about
2.30, Gordon and Dukes were alone in the shop
<!--Page 128--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
together. He heard them talking as he drove away.
Within a few minutes Dukes had killed Gordon with
a hammer, striking him on the back of his head.</p>

<p>I remember going with Blair and the police to the
scene of the murder. It was a little mean shop in a
main thoroughfare, about a hundred yards from the
Bolton Street Station. It was a building of two
stories and a cellar, and if the under floor of the
cellar had not been cement the murder might not
have been discovered for many years. For we saw
the chips in the edge of the flags, where Dukes had
removed one for experimental burial purposes.</p>

<p>The first thing Dukes did to cover up his tracks
was to send a telegram to the elder Gordon as from
George to say he had gone to Liverpool and would
not be back that night. The next day old Gordon
consulted the Manchester police, and the Bury police
were communicated with, but nothing was known
against Dukes, and the official view laughingly
communicated to the old man was that he would see
his son again when his money was spent and he was
tired of Liverpool. As far as we could reconstruct
his story from the evidence before us, Dukes, having
bought a pick and failed to dig a grave with it, wasted
a whole day without any further move. Then he
hit on the idea of putting the body into a wardrobe
which he was going to cart over the hills to Rochdale,
intending probably to throw the body out behind
some stone wall on the moors to the north or dispose
of it in some solitary place. For this purpose on
Thursday afternoon, two days after the murder,
<!--Page 129--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
he had hired a cart which was waiting at the
door.</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 25, was the New Year
in the Jewish calendar, when it is the custom of
Jewish families to gather together in the synagogue.
“Let us wait until the night of Wednesday,” said
George Gordon’s father, “and if George is alive he
will be with us, and if he be not here, then we shall
know he is dead.”</p>

<p>On Thursday morning there was no news of
George. The old man and his son Meyer went to the
Manchester police, and were referred to Bury. At
Bury they insisted that George was dead, and the old
man expressed his belief that his body was in the
shop in Central Street.</p>

<p>The police, more to pacify the distressed father
than from any belief in his fears, agreed to make a
search of the house, and thus it was that as the cart
stood outside waiting to load up the wardrobe which
Dukes was taking away, Sergeant Ross and two
constables with old Gordon and Meyer entered the
shop.</p>

<p>A thorough search was made, and the police for
the first time noticed signs of recent disturbances in
the cellar. Whilst the search was going on Dukes
made an exit down a side entry, and was brought
back by the police. Sergeant Ross began to take a
deeper interest in him. Nothing more serious, however,
was found, and they all stood in the little shop
around the wardrobe. It looked as if the business
of the police was over.</p>

<p><!--Page 130--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
“What is this wardrobe lying here for?” asked
old Gordon.</p>

<p>“It’s going out to Rochdale; the cart is waiting
outside for it now,” replied Dukes.</p>

<p>“Open it,” demanded the old man.</p>

<p>“I cannot. A lady bought it. She packed some
things in it, and locked it and took the key.”</p>

<p>“Then burst it open. It’s mine. Burst it open.”</p>

<p>There seemed no doubt what the old man expected
to see. A police officer prized the door. It flew
readily upward, disclosing its horrid, huddled contents.
Meyer flew at Dukes’s throat, crying, “You
have murdered my brother!” But the police pulled
him off, and saved Dukes for the law.</p>

<p>Early in December the case was heard, and we
pieced together by a large number of witnesses the
story of the murder. The prisoner made a statement
to the effect that he had been attacked by
Gordon and killed him in self-defence. It was a
lame effort, and even Cottingham’s eloquence could
not endow it with probability. It was a callous and
brutal murder, almost excusing the brutal comment
which I heard as I passed through the crowded hall
where the result was being discussed.</p>

<p>“Well, ’e won’t get any Christmas dinner, chuse
’ow.”</p>

<p>Dukes was hanged at Strangeways Gaol on
Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>I agree that there was little pity shown for Dukes,
who was a sodden, heartless creature, and a criminal
of the most degraded type. But the interest in the
<!--Page 131--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
trial swept away any sympathy or thought for
the victim and the unfortunate relatives who
had been plunged into sorrow by the act of the
criminal.</p>

<p>Just as I have no doubt that the sentence of death
for theft and other offences, well and reasonably and
sensibly defended by the more cautious property-owning
minds of the eighteenth century, was ultimately
abolished in deference to the sentiments of
the weaker-minded of the community and the real
necessities of society that they understood better
than their opponents, so I have no doubt the sentence
of death will pass away from our administration
of the law altogether before many years are past.
I do not suggest the question is a very burning one
from the point of view of criminal law, but from the
point of view of education and the evolution of right
action and conduct in the community, it seems to me
to be of importance. I am certainly far from
believing that anything I may say or write will
hasten matters, nor, indeed, is there any hurry about
the affair. It is only some three hundred years since
that good Christian gentleman, Sir Henry Wotton,
laid down the principle that the hanging of men was
an uncitizen-like act. True, the principle has long
been accepted by the majority, but we are a cautious
and conservative race. I have long ago ceased
expecting to see reforms come about in my own day.
I hear the statesman calling upon me to “Wait and
see!” and although I shall certainly wait as long as
I can, I shall not worry if it is not my lot to see. I
<!--Page 132--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
have very clear visions from my own little mountain
of the promised land that my great-grandchildren
and their youngsters will live in. It will be as far
removed from us as we are from the days of Sir
Henry Wotton, but what was good common-sense
in his day will be good common-sense in theirs, as it
is in ours, and ever shall be, world without end.</p>

<p class="p2">Peter considered those bad bold ones who spoke
evil of dignities were merely “presumptuous,” but
I am on the side of Jude, who roundly assessed them
to be “filthy dreamers.” Happily, to an Englishman,
evil speaking of judges is impossible. Indeed,
the English attitude of mind towards the Bench,
if one can conceive the English mind capable
of finding itself in an incorrect attitude, has a
tendency towards idolatry. The infallibility of the
Pope we smile at as a superstition, but the infallibility
of the Court of Appeal is an article of faith upon which
we issue execution, unless, of course, it is surpassed
and overruled by the more infallible infallibility of
the House of Lords. Only the will of the people and
the great inquest of the nation can alter a decision
of the House of Lords, unless there happens to be
a Government in office with a will of its own and the
capacity to act upon it&mdash;&#8203;and you never know what
may occur some day. And really we so love and
worship our judges that when we tell stories of
<!--Page 134--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
their quaint humours we do so much as a good
Italian Catholic will scold his patron saint or tell
some anecdote of the holy ones more lively than
respectful. For we know that judges are only
human, and we have seen many grow froward from
age, their faculties become dim, their qualities rust,
until at length they lose the one essential attribute of
judicality, they are no longer able to suffer fools
gladly, and the public and the Bar become uneasy
of their continuance. And, on the other hand,
what patience and loving-kindness are shown by
the advocate towards the judge. No hours are too
long, no time is misspent in preventing him from
error, or leading him thereto, as the case may be. I
love to hear that phrase trundled out with unblushing
sycophancy, “Your lordship will remember the
case of Crocks and the Wapping Corporation, in
fourteen ‘Meeson and Welsby.’” Every one in court&mdash;&#8203;except
perhaps some loafer in the gallery&mdash;&#8203;knows
that his lordship never heard of the case before, and
if he had would have forgotten it. Indeed, the
learned Counsel himself only had it shoved into his
hand an hour ago by little Smithson, who devils for
him, and it was I who met the disconsolate little
man in the Middle Temple Library and told him&mdash;&#8203;but
that is outside the frame of the picture. You
have the whole subject-matter set out in one phrase
“Contempt of Court.” This is a feeling that must
be closeted strictly within the heart&mdash;&#8203;otherwise
seven days.</p>

<p>I remember an irate Scotch draper saying quite
<!--Page 135--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
seriously to me at the end of a case, “I have an
utter contempt for this court.”</p>

<p>“My good man,” I said thankfully, “you have
saved me from a most painful duty. Had you
expressed a mere contempt of court I must have
sent you to Knutsford Gaol, but an utter contempt
seems to me to save you. But do not say it
again, I may be wrong. Go outside as quickly as
you can.”</p>

<p>He disappeared. Had I been a Plowden I should
have added “and utter contempt there.” But
I only thought of that going home in the tram.</p>

<p>And when I think of the judges of yesterday I
think first of all of the great and honest services they
rendered to the State, and then I recall them through
some quaint story, or maybe some trick of speech or
manner, just as you may remember a great cathedral
both as a mighty and noble building and as the
edifice from which sprang some grotesque gargoyle
whose humours have always haunted you when the
name of the building was sounded.</p>

<p>Of the many judges that came the Northern
Circuit during my short career at the Bar some few
are still, I am glad to say, judges of to-day, and
several have but recently passed away. And the
figure that is perhaps in the foreground of my
memory is that of Mr. Justice Grantham, who, less
than a year ago, vigorous and popular as ever,
celebrated his silver anniversary on the circuit.
I was present at the banquet given to him by the
circuit, and as he stood before us, four-square to the
<!--Page 136--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
winds of criticism and popular&mdash;&#8203;or perhaps I should
say unpopular&mdash;&#8203;disapproval, what human sympathy
and enthusiasm rang out in our cheers. We knew
him only as a hard-working, conscientious judge, as
a clean, honest man, and as that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis</i>, a south
country man who understood and admired the
bracing atmosphere of the north. He told us how,
when he was junior judge and the circuits were
chosen, that every circuit was taken by his seniors
except that containing Manchester and Liverpool,
for which he had to start out with the condolences of
his brethren. Now when he was senior judge he had
the first choice, and despite his years he came back
to Liverpool and Manchester because he liked the
straight, manly business methods in which the work
of the Northern Circuit is done. And what he said
was no mere after-dinner compliment, it was as honest
and true as the cheers of those who welcomed him
back. I have seen Grantham at his very worst
sitting on the bench, trying a political libel action;
I have seen Grantham at his very best standing in
an old Sussex wagon and judging a Bar point-to-point
steeple-chase, and I have seen him presiding as
judge in many different cases with varying success,
but I have never seen him do anything but what
he believed to be the only straight, honest thing to
do. That is why he was so exasperating and lovable.
He not only had strong, simple English ideals, but he
acted up to them in open daylight. Any man of
his ability and without his sincerity could have
steered a safer and easier course. Grantham could
<!--Page 137--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
only steer the straight course&mdash;&#8203;once his course
was set, he followed it with dogged fidelity. Small
wonder, therefore, that sometimes he ran on the
rocks. But when he did he bore no malice to the
rocks&mdash;&#8203;indeed, so optimistic and full of good
humour was he that he scarcely knew that there
had been a collision.</p>

<p>A little while ago Grantham made a speech to the
Liverpool grand jury which attracted much attention.
A few days afterwards I was present at the banquet
given to the judges at the Town Hall, and the
Lord Mayor of Liverpool called upon me to propose
the toast of the grand jury. There were no reporters
at these festivities, so it was not inconvenient to
make some humorous remarks at the learned judge’s
expense&mdash;&#8203;if one dared. I recall the shudder of
aldermanic apprehension when I started, and its
quick change to purple laughter when it was seen that
Grantham was thoroughly enjoying it all. I remember
as we left the banqueting hall his friendly
pat on the shoulder and his kindly laugh as he said,
“Very good fun, Parry! Just like old times!
But I was quite right, wasn’t I?” And there
you had the man at his best. There was no meanness
or littleness about him. He was honest, simple,
outspoken, cocksure, keen to do right and English
to the backbone. There was no policy or finesse in
anything that he did, and he was out for work and
business. That is why he was so welcome and
beloved on the Northern Circuit.</p>

<p>But his slackness in finesse often cost him tricks
<!--Page 138--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
in the Court of Appeal. Here is an example of
what I mean.</p>

<p>I appeared for a small carpenter whose shop had
been injured by the pulling down of adjoining
buildings to clear the site of a new infirmary. The
defendants were trustees of the institution. The
claim was £175 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 2<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>&mdash;&#8203;or some such figures&mdash;&#8203;and
I got a verdict for every pound, shilling, and penny,
in spite of Gully’s eloquence.</p>

<p>Grantham started his summing-up as follows&mdash;&#8203;I
quote, of course, from memory:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury, if you are as heartily glad
as I am that this is the last case at the Manchester
Assizes, and that, after this, we shall be able to get
away into pleasanter surroundings, you will not be
long in doing substantial justice to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p>I shall never forget how strange the words sounded
in the cold, grey light of the Court of Appeal, and
how Lord Esher roared out an encore to Gully when
he read them to the Court. We did not keep that
verdict. Smyly, Q.C., led me, and Esher, in one of
his wild humours, romped round the court with him
in playful savagery. One gem of Grantham’s was
in reference to Gully’s defence: “Then, gentlemen
of the jury, Mr. Parry is told he should have sued the
contractors instead of the trustees, and the contractors
would have said ‘sue the foreman,’ and the
foreman would have said ‘sue the hodman,’ and so
it would have been like the house that Jack built.”</p>

<p>“Which house is that, Mr. Smyly?” said Lord
Esher.</p>

<p><!--Page 139--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
“Really, my lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is it on either of the plans you have put in?”
continued the Master of the Rolls, waving them
about impatiently.</p>

<p>Bowen smiled like a benignant Cheshire cat.</p>

<p>“I am not certain,” continued Smyly, cautiously,
“that the house in question is in any way connected
with the case.”</p>

<p>“It must be,” said Esher, “or why did Mr. Justice
Grantham tell the jury about it.”</p>

<p>I was tugging away at Smyly’s gown, and he
turned round and asked what on earth the house that
Jack built was all about.</p>

<p>“A nursery rhyme. Don’t you know it? This is
the house that Jack built. This is the malt&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” interrupted Smyly, turning
round to the Court with great seriousness. “I have
consulted my learned junior, and he agrees with me
that the house that Jack built is not set out on the
plans, and that the house referred to by the learned
judge is in the nature of a literary allusion.”</p>

<p>Lord Esher laughed loud and long, and Bowen’s
smile broadened even more benignantly. The appeal
was lost, and we went to the House of Lords with
no success. Lord Hannen shook his head at me
sympathetically, saying, “Of two evils, I had
rather have a judge dead against me than strongly in
my favour.”</p>

<p>Lord Justice Vaughan Williams, who is now a
pillar of the Court of Appeal, used to come on circuit
a great deal. He began as a Commissioner, and we
<!--Page 140--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
stood greatly in awe of him, for he was a very learned
lawyer, and rather insisted on things being done in
legal decency and order. Some of the business
short cuts of the Northern Circuit he did not
appreciate.</p>

<p>I remember winning an important bankruptcy
case before Judge Heywood in Manchester. On
appeal we came before Vaughan Williams and
R.S. Wright, J.J. The other side had Sir Robert
Finlay, Q.C., and Yate Lee, afterwards the Stockport
judge, a great bankruptcy expert. Sir Horace
Davey, Q.C., was to lead me. The case came on in
the morning, and Sir Horace Davey was down at
the House of Lords. Finlay, seeing his advantage,
opened the case in twenty minutes as an obvious
mistake in the court below, and Yate Lee said
nothing. I was called on to hold the fort against a
hostile court until reinforcements in the shape of
Sir Horace Davey arrived. I had several cases to
quote, but the judges would not have them at any
price, and Vaughan Williams kept putting wonderful
legal conundrums to me, which I tried to answer or
evade as seemed the safer course at the moment.</p>

<p>When Davey came in about half-past three, I
think I had won Wright over to see there was something
in the points I had raised. Davey told me to
sit down, and he started at once. In his thinnest,
most arid, and contemptuous tones he explained to
the judges that it really did not matter which way
they decided, because the case would have to go to
the Court of Appeal. Still, it was a more convenient
<!--Page 141--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
thing that their lordships should decide rightly, or,
in other words for him, in accordance with the
authorities.</p>

<p>It is a great and rare gift to be able to talk like that
to High Court judges, but I felt we were seeking
trouble. Vaughan Williams listened for a while,
then looked sternly at Davey, and began very
quietly:</p>

<p>“Sir Horace, I have put a proposition to your
learned junior which he is utterly unable to answer,
and it is this&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The proposition was put.</p>

<p>Davey heard him with theatrical impatience and
weariness, and replied:</p>

<p>“My lord, I can understand my learned junior not
replying to your lordship’s proposition. Your lordship’s
proposition has nothing whatever to do with
this case. As I was saying when your lordship
interrupted me,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Of course we lost that appeal. The two judges
laughed Judge Heywood’s decision out of court, and
a few weeks afterwards the Court of Appeal restored
Judge Heywood’s decision, with appropriate astonishment
at the reasoning of the Divisional Court.
Such is the glorious uncertainty of the law.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Hawkins was often on circuit in the
earlier days. In the Crown Court he was painstaking,
but in the Civil Court anything like figures or business
details he found irksome. In one business case,
counsel began discussing the question of the fall of
1-16<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> in the price of yarn, when Hawkins indignantly
<!--Page 142--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
interrupted him by asking whether the time
of her Majesty’s judges was to be spent in dealing
with fractions of the smallest coin of the realm.
Finding that in the result it came to a goodly sum,
he referred the case, and spent the rest of the day
elucidating a slander action, which resulted in a
verdict for another fraction of a penny.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Cave very often visited the Northern
Circuit. He was a stout, heavy, round-faced
man, spoke with a nasal twang, and occasionally
slept on the bench, but in spite of his peculiarities
he was a straightforward, useful lawyer,
and a not unkindly judge. He treated the junior
Bar with good-humoured toleration, but I cannot
say he suffered them gladly. Louis Aitken, who was
the most scrupulous prosecutor on circuit, was one
day prosecuting a thief before Cave at Lancaster,
and finding that a statement of a policeman on the
depositions was made in the absence of the prisoner,
and therefore not evidence, properly and carefully
omitted it. Cave, who was following the depositions
with his thumb and a blue pencil, pulled him
up:</p>

<p>“Ow now. Ow now, Mr. Aitken,” he said, in his
snarling voice. “This won’t do, you know. You’re
garbling the evidence. That’s what you’re doing,
garbling the evidence.”</p>

<p>Aitken was too stunned to say anything, and Cave
took the policeman through the whole statement.
When he had finished, he snapped out: “Any other
questions, Mr. Aitken?”</p>

<p><!--Page 143--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
“Only this, my lord,” said Aitken, who had
recovered his equanimity. “Was the prisoner
present during that conversation?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the officer.</p>

<p>“Ow,” grumbled Cave, as he took his blue pencil
and scored it out of his notes. “Remember,
gentlemen of the jury, to forget all that. It’s not
evidence. Go on, Mr. Aitken.”</p>

<p>A few days after Aitken was dining with the
judges, and Cave nodded across the table to him and
said, “Lucky we spotted that evidence point at
Lancaster, Mr. Aitken.”</p>

<p>I remember, too, in a small libel case the perfect
sang-froid with which he transferred the blame of
his proceedings on to the shoulders of Lancaster
Woodburne, one of our most serious juniors who had
something of the south country style. On a hot
summer afternoon Woodburne had opened a very
unimportant case in a highly impassioned speech, and
when he had finished was horrified to find that Cave
really was fast asleep. We had often seen him make
the attempt, but this was the full offence. The
weather and the luncheon hour were accessories
before the fact.</p>

<p>“What on earth shall I do?” he muttered to me.
I suggested he should call a witness, but Woodburne
objected that the judge would not hear his evidence.
As I was on the other side this did not seem to me
to be very material. The judge’s clerk was out of
court, the Associate, well knowing the state of
affairs, was busily writing below the bench with
<!--Page 144--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
his eyes glued on to his papers. The jury, indeed,
were smiling broadly. There was no doubt that
it was a painful moment for Lancaster Woodburne.
Suddenly a pile of books near my elbow upset on
the floor. Cave opened his eyes and shouted angrily
at my opponent:</p>

<p>“Now then, Mr. Woodburne, why are you wasting
the time of the Court? Are you going to call a
witness, or am I to sit here all day doing nothing?”</p>

<p>How different again in manner and manhood was
Mr. Justice A. L. Smith. We were all glad to hear
that he was coming the circuit. “A. L.,” as he was
affectionately called, had a strong, breezy business
manner of doing his work that suited Manchester
admirably.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Russell once said to a new County Court
judge, “Better to be strong and wrong than weak
and right.” It is a counsel of perfection to all
judges of first instance. “A. L.” understood the
idea and acted upon it, and went one better by being
seldom wrong. The main reason of his popularity and
success as a judge was that he knew his own mind
and was always ready to take responsibility promptly.</p>

<p>One of my earliest recollections of “A. L.” was in
1887, when a man named Thomas Leatherbarrow
was put in the dock and charged with the murder of a
woman. The prisoner had been very violent in the
police court, and the chief witness against him was
another woman he had tried to kill. He came into
the dock, a powerful giant, surrounded by three or
four warders. He lurched forward to the rails and
<!--Page 145--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
gazed wildly round the court like a savage animal
looking for prey.</p>

<p>Mr. Shuttleworth, the Clerk of Assize, read the
indictment.</p>

<p>“Guilty,” growled the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Do you understand what you are pleading guilty
to?” asked Mr. Shuttleworth.</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>“It means killing intentionally.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man with a burst of passion, “and
I would have killed the other, too, if I could have
got at her.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to say?” asked the Clerk of
Assize.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” answered the prisoner carelessly.</p>

<p>“A. L.,” who had been thoughtfully watching
the scene, assumed the black cap and passed sentence
without comment.</p>

<p>The prisoner nodded to him, picked up his cloth
cap from a chair, and said, “Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“A. L.” and the prisoner were perhaps the only
two men who at the moment were clear and contented
that the right thing had been done.</p>

<p>But it was in the County Courts that one learned
one’s first lessons, and as more and more those
courts are becoming the elementary schools of advocacy
it becomes increasingly important that the
judges who preside should have had some sound
experience in the business themselves. We youngsters
in Manchester were greatly to be congratulated
on the presence of Judge Russell, the learned author
<!--Page 146--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
of a well-known treatise on Mercantile Law, who
presided in the Manchester County Court. Russell
sifted out his advocates very rapidly. At first when
you knew little or nothing about it he did the case
more or less for you. If he found you had any
initiative capacity at all he allowed you to flutter
your wings on your own. But if you tried to soar to
absurd heights he non-suited you on the wing, as it
were, to prevent more serious accidents in the course
of your aviation; indeed, he was if anything too fond
of the non-suit, regarding it as a very present help
in time of trouble. But though somewhat strict in
technical matters, he was a good lawyer and a
useful judge for a junior to practise before. If
you could do your work to his satisfaction you need
not fear making your bow in the High Court. He
was an autocrat, but his autocracy was beneficial
to business and justice. Anything like trickiness
or ill-faith was abhorrent to him. On one occasion
a very learned but rather artful counsel read a
correspondence to him and omitted a damaging
letter, hoping, no doubt, to deal with it later on.
When the letter came out Russell looked very black.</p>

<p>“Is that letter in your bundle of correspondence,
Mr. X.?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Honour&mdash;&#8203;and I was going&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Were going&mdash;&mdash;” repeated Russell sarcastically.
“Judgment for defendant.”</p>

<p>It is wonderful how easily a good or bad reputation
is made, and how careful the young advocate should
be to keep his shield unspotted. I remember
<!--Page 147--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
having a very bad class of insurance claim which
was tried before Lord Coleridge. Some Blackburn
people had insured an old gentleman, described as
an egg merchant, who died very shortly afterwards.
It appeared that the deceased’s employment in recent
years had been leaning against the door of a public-house
and falling in when it opened. He had not
merchanted any eggs since 1862. These things and
the rascality of the whole proceeding, which was
little short of a conspiracy to defraud, became so
apparent as the case went on that at last I said
I could not believe in the truth of my evidence,
and refusing to call any more witnesses told Lord
Coleridge my reasons, and retired from the case.</p>

<p>Lord Coleridge smiled somewhat sarcastically,
as I thought, saying, “A very candid expression of
opinion about your clients, Mr. Parry, and I have no
doubt the jury will agree with you.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later I was supporting a counterclaim
in a weary, complicated case at Liverpool, the
last in the list before Coleridge, without a jury.
I felt sure that if he would adjourn to the next day
I could make him see there was something in it.
Addison, who was for the other side, ridiculed it,
and I quite thought Coleridge would cut it short
and run up to town. About 6 o’clock, however,
Coleridge said, “I haven’t the least idea what Mr.
Parry’s counterclaim is about, and you think it is
all nonsense, Mr. Addison; but I am sure he believes
in it, and, as I know he wouldn’t continue a case
unnecessarily, I shall adjourn.” We had the best
<!--Page 148--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
part of next day at the details, and my client got a
substantial verdict.</p>

<p>Judge Hughes, when he was appointed, was
expected to do wonderful things, and so, in truth,
he did, but the authorship of “Tom Brown’s
Schooldays” was not a particularly good apprenticeship
for the rough and tumble of the County Court,
and his short cuts to ideal justice were seldom
successful. One of his earliest exploits, when asked
to decide who had won a race and was entitled to
the prize, was to order it to be run again, with himself
as referee! Apart from the judgment being
without legal sanction, the point at issue was not
who could win, but who had won the race. On
another occasion, during the trial of the disputed
ownership of a dog, the animal came into court,
and the learned judge had him up on the bench.
He then ordered the defendant to go to the other
side of the court and call the dog. This the defendant
did, and the dog came to him. Immediately
judgment was given for the defendant, but the
plaintiff complained that he had not been allowed a
similar experiment, which very likely would have
resulted in a similar way.</p>

<p>Chancery law was supposed to be a speciality with
Judge Hughes, but I doubt if he had any real grip of
any kind of legal principles. For instance, Byrne
and I had a case before him in which a lady claimed
specific performance of an agreement. It was a
home-made agreement about the transfer of furniture,
and it contained, among other things, a promise to
<!--Page 149--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
marry. Judge Hughes in his kind-hearted, impulsive
way espoused the lady’s cause most warmly. “Why
did my client refuse to marry the lady? It was
abominable conduct.” For the defendant I tried to
urge legal difficulties about decreeing specific performance
to marry, but Judge Hughes only shook his
head indignantly and kept muttering to himself,
“I shall see that agreement carried out&mdash;&#8203;every line
of it! Every line of it!”</p>

<p>During the adjournment I chaffed Byrne about
his agreement&mdash;&#8203;of course, he had not drawn it&mdash;&#8203;and
asked him how the judge was going to carry
out his order to compel my client to marry.
Both our clients were very obstinate, but in the
end Byrne and I made a full and fair settlement
of all matters in dispute, though I shall always
believe that my client was the more easy to deal with,
because he believed that Judge Hughes intended to
have him locked up, and only released when he
consented to go quietly to the altar. When we
returned into court and announced the settlement
the learned judge was very vexed with Byrne, and
waved us away, saying, “I wasn’t frightened at
Mr. Parry’s law, and you needn’t have been. I’d
have had that agreement carried out&mdash;&#8203;every line of
it! Every line of it!”</p>

<p>As a Druid under an oak tree or on some island far
from the Court of Appeal, Judge Hughes would have
administered his own equity to perfection, and the
suitors would have had an honest, righteous and
sporting tribunal. But the administering of laws
<!--Page 150--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
made by others was altogether beyond his imagination.
He was stone deaf to common law, and his
equity dated back to a period before the discovery of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p>Coventry, the judge of the Blackpool Circuit, was
a different type of man altogether. Silent, reserved,
and patient, he listened at too great length to both
advocacy and evidence, but his decision when it
came was sound in judgment and of few words.
Charles Costeker, of Darwen, who loved a sporting
litigation, once instructed me to defend a most
unusual case before Coventry in the Blackburn
County Court. The defendants were the vicar and
churchwardens of a Darwen church. It appeared
the plaintiff had taken a dislike to hearing the curate
preach, and used to walk out in order to avoid doing
so. This insult to the curate the churchwardens
resolved to avenge, and one Sunday morning, when
the plaintiff tried to leave the church as usual, they
locked the door and sat near it and prevented him
going out. He, therefore, sued them for damages for
false imprisonment. The vicar knew nothing about
it, but as far as the churchwardens were concerned,
there was really no answer, though I discovered a
canon of the Church that makes it one’s duty to stay
and diligently hear the sermon. Coventry, however,
was not having anything to do with such an obscure
affair as canon law, and the common law was clearly
against us. I am afraid the judge, who was of
Quaker origin, and some of the advocates were
woefully at sea over the details of the Church service,
<!--Page 151--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
and an old Lancashire verger amused us greatly with
one of his replies to Coventry. He was asked
when he first noticed the plaintiff come into the
church.</p>

<p>“It was during Venaite!” he replied.</p>

<p>“How long after the service began?” asked
Coventry.</p>

<p>“It was during Venaite,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know anything about the
Venite,” said Coventry, who hadn’t an idea of its
liturgical position. “What I want to know is was
it ten minutes after the service began, or when?”</p>

<p>“It was during Venaite.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what you mean by that,”
said Coventry, putting down his pen in despair.
The verger thought the word Venite was puzzling
the learned judge, and with great friendliness and a
pleased smile of superiority turned round and said to
him, “I’ll tell yer about Venaite. It’s like what you
an’ me if we were talking to ourselves ’ud say: ‘O
coom, let’s sing to the Loord.’”</p>

<p>Crompton Hutton, a very learned man of a curious,
cantankerous character, held sway over the Bolton
and Bury district. He had had a large practice in
London as a junior, and though his methods were
irregular they did not lack common sense. He never
wore robes, and I was told it was an offence to
appear in his court in robes. The first time I went
before him was at Bury, where he sat in a club-room
adjoining the court. I was very frightened, and he
glared at me in a way that did not make me less

nervous. I and the solicitor against me, Mr. Anderton,
sat on each side of him at a long table with the
fire opposite the judge. I found out afterwards that
if you could get one of your opponent’s witnesses to
stand between Crompton Hutton and the fire he was
dismissed the room, and his evidence was never
heard. I did not know these and other rules of the
court then. The judge pointed to a seat, and I sat
down.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Parry,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What does he say his name is, Mr. Anderton?”
he asked my opponent, turning his back on me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parry,” replied Anderton.</p>

<p>“H’m. How do you spell it. I never heard such
a name,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>This made me very angry, and I retorted, in much
the same tone: “Of course you’ve heard it constantly.
I’ve seen your name in the law reports with
my father’s, Serjeant Parry, many a time.”</p>

<p>Crompton Hutton rose in his chair and spread out
his arms as though he was going to hug me.</p>

<p>“What, are you a son of the dear old Serjeant?
Really, now. And what are you doing in these
God-forsaken parts? Sit down. Delighted.” And
he wrung me by the hand in the most friendly
fashion.</p>

<p>The case was about a milk float and a lurry. I
was for the lurry, and we won, mainly, as far as I
remember, because an imaginative office boy of
Anderton’s had drawn his client’s milk float galloping
<!--Page 153--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
up the road on the wrong side of the way with the
driver waving his whip, and Crompton Hutton
regarded it as a conclusive admission of facts.</p>

<p>Anderton was a big, heavy, red-faced man of the
elder Weller type, and quite as kind-hearted and
straightforward. As we walked across to the
Derby Arms for some lunch when the case was
over:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I tell you what it is,” he said to me, “you’ll do
very well with Crumpy, but you’ll have to do what
he tells you.”</p>

<p>“About what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“About wearing that toggery. He won’t stand
it.”</p>

<p>However, he had to stand it, and, fair play to
him, though he used to tease me about it, we never
quarrelled over it. I went before him often, and
much pleased him by persuading the Divisional
Court to uphold him on appeal in a building case.</p>

<p>I became quite a favourite of his, and he would
always take a case of mine first when he could. I
remember once two Chancery men with long affidavits
and witnesses to cross-examine were ahead of
me, and Crompton Hutton as soon as they were
seated turned round to the defendant’s counsel and
said, “Call your client.”</p>

<p>“Call my client?” said the astonished advocate.
“I want to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses
first.”</p>

<p>“I know you do,” said the judge with a sneer,
“but we don’t waste time that way here. You will
<!--Page 154--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
be asking for further consideration next, but you
won’t get it here.”</p>

<p>“But I’m entitled to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Certainly, but not at other people’s expense.
Now, Mr. Parry.”</p>

<p>And the Chancery protests were unavailing. I
got heard and sent away.</p>

<p>I just caught the beginning of the Chancery case.
The defendant’s counsel was again asked to put the
defendant in the box, and refused.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you why,” said Crompton Hutton.
“I’ve read those affidavits, and unless the defendant
swears the necessary additional facts you’ve no case,
and if he swears the necessary additional facts I’ll
commit him for trial for perjury. That’s all!”</p>

<p>There was a lot of common sense about Crompton
Hutton.</p>

<p class="p2">I suppose in early days the “stranger” must have
been a sadly persecuted individual, else why should
there be so many texts persuasively commending
him to the care of the righteous. Even now there
are some communities and clubs where to be a
“stranger” is to be set apart and treated like a
leper. Those out-houses in which guests are housed
in some of the pre-historic London clubs are examples
of what I mean. In earlier cannibal times no doubt
the “stranger” was merely a welcome addition to
the larder, but even then there seem to have been
ceremonies and rites in the fattening and final
presentation of the guest which students of folk-lore
would regard as the early manifestations of hospitality.
However that may be, there is no doubt that
in the treatment of the stranger within the gates
the north country is farther removed from barbarism
than the south. In London, for instance,
every man is a stranger. I have met fellow-countrymen
from the Colonies who found the welcome
secured by introductions to London to be an entirely
<!--Page 156--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
formal and cold-blooded affair compared with that
extended to them by a similar class in the north.
Not only in London, but taking its anti-social note
from London, the surrounding south is chilly and
aloof towards its fellow-man, especially if the fellow-man
talks broadly with an open accent, and has not
attained that weary, blurred, mincing tongue which
serves the southerner in lieu of speech. It is not so
much that in these sunny latitudes we have forgotten
our duty to our neighbour, but rather that we have
never had any neighbours, that we have made it a
religion not to have neighbours, and continue to live
for years and years in our semi-detached surburban
villas without exchanging a word with the man next
door, whose ties and trousers do daily offence to such
creeds as we still possess. Whereas the gospel seems
to have taught the uncultivated men and women
who live on those wild stretches of railway beyond
Rugby and Crewe that everyone is a neighbour, and
must be treated according to the text in that case
made and provided.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the kindness of my first
friends in Manchester, from which sprang many
other pleasant friendships. No end of folk seemed
to take an interest in our small household. I think
some came to look at us out of curiosity. The
impertinence and absurdity of an unfledged stranger
settling down among them in this way seemed to
amuse them. I remember taking in to dinner the
wife of an eminent professor who made it her duty
to know the inner household affairs of all those
<!--Page 157--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
tenements and hereditaments situated or adjacent to
the Oxford Road, between Nelson Street in the north
and the White Lion in the south.</p>

<p>Turning to me as the cloth was removed, she said
in a tone half of entreaty, half of command, “Tell
me, Mr. Parry&mdash;&#8203;I have heard so many different
accounts and I really must know&mdash;&#8203;what did you
marry on?”</p>

<p>I had the presence of mind to answer, “Nothing,
madam, absolutely nothing!”</p>

<p>The romance of it touched her tender heart, dear
soul, and she was for ever asking us to dinner under
the firm belief that we were starving.</p>

<p>Certainly no strangers ever had a kinder reception
than we had in the north, and it seemed to make
the months of waiting for those first briefs pass
very smoothly and pleasantly. And what made
life more joyous than anything I had experienced
was the professional comradeship of those among
whom one’s work had to be done. There were still
many circuit wanderers domiciled in London who
followed her Majesty’s judges when they went
their rounds, but there were also a large number
of local barristers who dominated the Quarter
Sessions and did the work in the County Courts.
All those were, of course, members of the Northern
Circuit, and in the absence of the assizes, upheld
in their daily struggles the spirit of sympathy
and good-fellowship for which the Northern Circuit
is justly famous. Even the Chancery men who
made vast fortunes in the Palatine Court joined
<!--Page 158--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
the circuit, and became less sterilised and better
humanised under the fragrant influences of Bar mess.</p>

<p>How curious it is that the common law mind
always thinks of a Chancery man with pity mingled
with a certain distaste. Pity which is sworn servant
unto love springs from our admiration of the
Chancery man as a human person; the distaste is
engendered spontaneously, and arises, I fancy, out
of and in the course of his occupation. He wears
to all appearances a similar gown, his wig is of the
same iron grey, he quotes from somewhat fatter and
duller books perhaps, but they are written in much
the same joyless jargon&mdash;&#8203;I never met a jolly, breezy,
merry, law book&mdash;&#8203;and yet there is something in the
flavour of him that you find in professors and schoolmasters,
the drier sort of vicars and policemen. Is
this shrinking from the Chancery man some prejudice
atavistically reproduced from the days of “Jarndyce
v. Jarndyce,” or a manifestation of eugenic instinct?
It is difficult to say, but I know that it is not a merely
personal prepossession. The old court-keeper at
Strangeways acknowledged to the feeling, and he saw
more of the Chancery men than he did of the common
law men, for the Palatine Court he had always with
him. I asked him once to explain to me the reason
of it, but it was beyond his powers of analysis. He
had the same instinct about Chancery men that was
inspired in the mind of Tom Brown by the late
Dr. Fell, but the reason why he could not tell. I
discovered this quite accidentally and it became a
bond of union between us. It happened in this way.</p>

<p><!--Page 159--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
A small light and air case had&mdash;&#8203;like some seedling
weed&mdash;&#8203;got blown into the assize list from across the
corridor where the Palatine Court droned along, and
with it came Astbury. Yes, Astbury&mdash;&#8203;even Astbury
was once a junior and sat in the back row. I was
against him. I think it was the fault of Stephen,
J., who did not understand plans, or the superior
cunning of Astbury, who built up a model of the
buildings with volumes of “Barnewall and Alderson,”
and by the kindergarten methods of Froebel captured
the judgment of the Court; or maybe, as I told my
client afterwards, we never had a leg to stand upon,
and Astbury had the right end of the stick&mdash;&#8203;he was
often attached to that end. Be all that as it may,
Chancery defeated Common law utterly and with
costs.</p>

<p>I can see our good janitor’s gloomy face as he
leaned over the carved end of the seats and gazed
wearily at us. We were the last non-jury of the
assizes, and he was waiting with the charwomen
in ambush to do the washing up. “Eh! Mr.
Parry,” he said with a deep sigh, almost a groan,
“and to think of you being beat&mdash;&#8203;and by a Chancery
man.” It seemed a thing hard to bear at the time
and likely to be fraught with ruin, but it was forgotten,
and now I recall it more as a story of misfortune
than disgrace. For it is easier to remember
the ill turns of fortune’s wheel than the lucky
ones. How meanly we bluster over memories of
ill-luck, and never give a thought to the briefs that
leaped the bunkers and the points of law that
<!--Page 160--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
holed out from the edge of the green. The other
fellow’s good fortune we remember sneeringly well,
but our own&mdash;&#8203;well, it is a common failing, and
certainly I am not more free from it than another.
But I suppose every one who has had any fortune
at all at the Bar could tell some amusing stories of
accidents that have helped him to success. Certainly
in my short round&mdash;&#8203;I only played nine holes, as it
were, for within ten years of my call I was a judge&mdash;&#8203;I
cannot grumble at my luck, and some of the early
chances which brought me briefs were as unexpected
as they were entertaining.</p>

<p>It must have been within a year of my coming to
Manchester that I was met by a glad surprise when
I went down to the Assize Courts to my usual
occupation of sitting in the back row and listening
to others do cases in a manner that made me feel
really sorry for them, their clients and myself.
Wandering along the corridor in a weary and somewhat
melancholy way, feeling that I had no real
part in this hustling crowd of excited litigants and
lawyers that the first day of assizes brings together,
I was suddenly handed&mdash;&#8203;a brief. If it had been a
writ or a County Court summons or&mdash;&#8203;but it was a
brief. And there I was charged with the responsibility
of defending a tradesman who, with his
servant girl, was indicted for conspiracy to conceal
the birth of the latter’s child. The papers were
marked “15 and 1. With you Mr. Addison, Q.C.”
I had never heard of the solicitor, and he took
occasion to let me know that he had never heard of
<!--Page 161--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
me, and had had some trouble to find anyone who
had. However, there was the brief, a very fine specimen
of that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis</i>, and I promenaded with it
under my arm or left it lying about in prominent
places in hopes that it would act as a decoy.
Towards the end of the sittings Addison defended
the prisoner with great success&mdash;&#8203;I had really nothing
to do but look on&mdash;&#8203;and both he and McKeand,
who defended the girl, obtained acquittals. The
case created some sensation in the local town
where the prisoners came from, and I heard that the
prisoners and their counsel were burnt in effigy on
the evening of the trial.</p>

<p>I never learnt the solution of that mysterious
brief until years afterwards. What had happened
was this. I had been defending some prisoners for
McKeand in the second court at Salford Sessions,
one being the case of a man charged with assault on
a woman, in which, to my own and other people’s
surprise, there was an acquittal. The prisoner in the
assize case was on the jury in that case, and when
his own turn came, having seen no other counsel
defending prisoners than Parry, he came to the conclusion
that Parry was essential to his liberty.
Nothing that his solicitor could do could alter his
determination, so the sensible solicitor obeyed his
client’s instructions and with some difficulty discovered
Parry, and then in order that his client
might have a really good run for his money he gave
Addison a leading brief.</p>

<p>One solicitor came to me for elaborate opinions
<!--Page 162--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
on difficult points of law, and always marked the
brief Dr. Parry. I found out that in a local list of
the Bar, my name being next Pankhurst’s at the
bottom of the page, the printer had repeated the
Dr.&mdash;&#8203;really it is quite as good a way of obtaining
a degree as any other&mdash;&#8203;but my practice as a doctor
of law ended after six months when a new and
correct list was printed.</p>

<p>I had a visit once from a solicitor from Burnley
with his client, a bookmaker. They had some talk
outside with my clerk and then came in. The
bookmaker nodded and said, “That’s him,” and
appeared to be very satisfied. His great anxiety
about his case, which was a summons for keeping a
betting house, is best expressed in his own instructions,
which he repeated to me several times. “I
ain’t partickler what I pays, but I want yer ter see
that at the end of the case there ain’t no going
down stairs.”</p>

<p>The county magistrates let him off with a fine of
£80. He was a well-known and not unrespected
character, and perhaps had met some of the justices
in another place. He seemed to think the magistrates
pocketed the money, for he took it very
philosophically, and said as he crumpled up the
receipt for the fine: “After all, it’s quite natural
they should try and get a bit of their own back
to-day, but I’ll have my turn presently.”</p>

<p>I learned afterwards that the bookmaker was an
admirer of my style of advocacy. His solicitor, a
broad Lancashire man, told me the story of it.
<!--Page 163--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
“He comes to me and says ‘I want that two-year-old
I sees at Bury County Court last week.’ What’s
his name? I asked. ‘Hanged if I know,’ says he,
‘but he’s a long, lean, lanky beggar, and he puts one
foot on the desk and just talks to the judge like ’as
if he was his feyther.’ With that I came to Manchester,
and I was talking to one of Cobbett’s
clerks and I repeats the description, and before
the words were out of my mouth he says ‘Parry!’
So we comes round to your chambers, and sure
enough he was right.”</p>

<p>Had one the pencil of Sir Thomas Overbury, how
pleasant it would be to draw the outline portraits
of the worthy characters of my comrades of the
Northern Circuit. Looking back on my short
sojourn among them, two men seem to stand out as
types of the genius of the circuit, Gully and Charley
McKeand. Both were ideally honest and full of
consideration for their opponents, and it is in these
qualities that I think the Northern Circuit is pre-eminent.</p>

<p>But though they shared these good attributes they
had little else in common. Charley McKeand was
as rough and blustering in his advocacy as Gully was
smooth and polished. Gully wounded his victims with
a rapier, McKeand with a bludgeon. All advocacy
ought to be straightforward, and the bulk of it is.
Certainly, the standard of honesty and open dealing
on the Northern Circuit is a very high one. But Gully
and McKeand were the Quixotes of the Bar, and
when a junior like myself had to appear against
<!--Page 164--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
either of them he realised what a refreshing thing
it is in advocacy to be concerned in a case where,
however powerful is the frontal attack, there are to
be no ambushes or ambuscades.</p>

<p>Charley McKeand had not anything of the
appearance of a leader of the Bar, yet he developed
rapidly into a very clever advocate, and
would have done big things but for his untimely
death. The first impression of him was of a big,
jolly, careless Englishman, rather stout and easy-going,
fond of sport and sporting companions. But
give him a brief, and his attitude towards life
changed. He was never a learned lawyer, but he
knew the law of evidence well, and would get some
junior to “devil” the legal circumstances of any
case that had any law in it, and quickly picked up
all that was necessary to his purpose. He began
his advocate’s career in the right way, by defending
prisoners from the dock. If, with a copy of the
depositions in front of you and an oft-convicted
thief in the dock behind you, the verdict is “Not
guilty,” you may know that you are qualifying for
an advocate. Charley McKeand did it&mdash;&#8203;not once,
but again and again. There was no apparent
art in his style, but he thundered out the most
absurd suggestions of a hopeless defence with an
energy and enthusiasm that often inspired a belief
in them in the minds of an inexperienced jury. He
soon became the fashion, and no criminal would
be without him if he could possibly afford his
services.</p>

<p><!--Page 165--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
He was one of the most popular figures in Manchester,
and the mob, who always take the side of the
unfortunate nobleman in the dock, called him in their
good-natured adoration “The People’s Charley.”
When he defended a cabman at the police court who
had got into some trouble with the authorities over
hackney coach bye-laws and defeated the police,
the cabmen of St. Anne’s Square cheered him as he
drove his phæton down to court with his bull-dog
by his side, and held a mass meeting and sent a
deputation to his chambers to present him with a
handsome gold-mounted malacca.</p>

<p>It was about this time that he was pressed to stand
for municipal honours. Certainly no Nonconformist
conscience could have stood a chance against “The
People’s Charley.” He greatly enjoyed the first
invitation he received. A few of the inner circle
of the politicians of a certain ward came to visit
and ask him to stand as a Conservative candidate at
the next municipal election.</p>

<p>“But I heard Mr. X. was going to stand,” said
McKeand, naming a very respectable citizen.</p>

<p>“Nay, Mr. McKeand,” said the spokesman,
dwelling lovingly on three syllables of his name.
“Nay, Mr. McKeand, we don’t want Mr. X., we
wants you. Mr. X. ain’t anything to the likes o’
us. You know our ward, Mr. McKeand. It’s full
of bookmakers and thieves and rat-catchers&mdash;&#8203;you
knows the sort and they knows you&mdash;&#8203;and they’ll
vote for you like one man.”</p>

<p>However, McKeand had no ambition for a seat on
<!--Page 166--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
the City Council and stuck to his work in court, of
which he was really fond.</p>

<p>His readiness and resource were extraordinary
and he said and did the most startling things without
offending the most straight-laced judicial persons.
Hopwood was presiding in a third court at the
assizes, trying some of the minor prisoners. An old
woman indicted for larceny had given McKeand a
dock defence, and he rushed in at the last moment
to make a speech on her behalf. It was clear he had
not had time to study the depositions, but a few
words from Ernest Jordan, who was devilling the
case, put him on the right line, and he was soon in
the middle of an eloquent harangue. Coming to the
end of it he exclaimed, “And what, gentlemen, did
the poor woman say when the magistrate’s clerk
asked her for her defence. I will read you her very
words, and I think you will agree with me that they
bear the stamp of conscious innocence.” Ernest
Jordan tried to stem the torrent of his eloquence
here, feeling sure he was remembering another set of
depositions, but it was no use. McKeand seized the
papers and turned them rapidly over. “Let me
read you her exact words. Ha! Here we are. Oh!
H’m!” He faltered a little when he saw them.
“Well, gentlemen, this uneducated woman does not
put it as you or I would put it, but I said I would
read her words, and I will. What she says is: ‘How
the hell could I have the &mdash;&mdash; boots when he
was wearing them?’ And, gentlemen,” continued
McKeand in a concluding burst of eloquence,
<!--Page 167--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
“I ask you, with some confidence, how the hell
could she?”</p>

<p>Charley McKeand must have been seriously
thinking of taking silk when the end came, and a
terrible end it was both to himself and his friends.
After the summer vacation I went round to his
house to see him, and found him on the eve of a visit
to London to see Sir Frederick Treves.</p>

<p>The Manchester doctors had told him that he was
suffering from cancer, and that they feared it was
hopeless to operate. He was very calm about it, and
did not expect any better verdict, but he thought it
satisfactory to take another opinion. The opinion
went against him, but he returned to his work, and
for three months, though in great pain and under
sentence of lingering death, continued his work with
cheerfulness and energy. It was a noble example to
those of us who fret over small troubles, and I do not
think it was lost on any who witnessed it. In
December he became too ill to continue work, and
gave up his chambers. I last saw him at Brighton.
We dined together, and I sat telling him old circuit
stories and recalling cases we had fought together
until late into the night. He came to the door to
see me off, and I said I would look him up at home
when he returned. He shook his head, and said
with his delightful smile, “Not a bit of it, Parry.
We have had an excellent evening, and this is the
time to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>He died a few weeks afterwards, having been
spared long enough to see his only child. Until the
<!--Page 168--><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
tragedy happened I do not think any of us had fully
understood what a force of quiet bravery there was
in Charley McKeand.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to remember Gully as Lord
Selby, but for the life of me I cannot. As Gully we
loved and admired him, and as Gully he will always
remain to those of us who are proud to have been his
juniors. Undoubtedly he was one of the best and
most inspiring leaders that a band of advocates
could honour.</p>

<p>There were those who said that Gully had had all
the life hammered out of him by Charles Russell,
but there was no truth in this at all. For years he
had stood up against Russell in case after case, and
it must be agreed that anyone who came in contact
with that forceful genius had to stand a fair share of
hammering. But Gully was chosen for the part
because he was the fittest to enact it, and when
Russell “went special” Gully naturally took his
place as leader of the circuit, a position he held until
he retired to a more honourable office. I was both
with and against Gully in many cases. A barrister,
like an actor or a sailor, is dependent for his happiness
on his companions, and especially his superiors.
Gully was peculiarly courteous and considerate to
his juniors, Russell was often the reverse. The
latter would turn round to a junior and, not getting
the immediate answer he wanted, say, “What on
earth are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Taking a note,” one junior replied with conscious
rectitude.</p>

<p><!--Page 169--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
“Don’t,” said Russell with an explosive interjection;
“attend to the case.”</p>

<p>It must not be thought that Russell was only rude
to his juniors. Let us remember with pleasure that
he was the advocate who, when asked by a Law Lord
for some authority for a proposition, called out in his
most rasping voice, “Usher! Go into the library and
bring me any elementary book on common law.”</p>

<p>But just as Russell’s manner cannot be reproduced
in print because it was unprintable, so the charm of
Gully’s presence eludes you in words that give an
effect of weakness and softness which was not really
his quality.</p>

<p>I once heard a Lancaster juryman coming out of
court say “I likes Mr. Gully, he speaks so gentlemanlike.”
This word does not quite convey its meaning
in the printed form, you want the burr of the North
Country in its pronunciation and the affectionate tone
in which it was uttered, and the smile of content that
lighted up the speaker’s face as he thought of Gully.
One secret of Gully’s success as an advocate was
conscience. I doubt if any advocate is worth his
salt without a highly developed conscience. With
Gully it was not only there, but it worked automatically,
and he never argued with it. He did
the straight thing naturally. And Gully was like
Charley McKeand, a great comrade. He had a high
ideal of circuit life, as those who went the circuit
under his leadership can testify. I think of him as
a gentleman in the real old English sense of the word,
such as Master Izaak Walton knew in the friend he
<!--Page 170--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
describes as “learned and humble, valiant and
inoffensive, virtuous and communicable.”</p>

<p>I went into the corridors of the Strangeways Courts
the other day, and ghost-like I paced round the
haunts of my early days. Very few were the
familiar faces. I have no doubt the old circuit is as
full of laughter and good fellowship as ever it was,
but to me it is a memory, and in the foreground of
the memory stand the figures of two dear comrades,
Gully and Charley McKeand.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS</h4>

<p class="small">Whether in the biography of a nation, or of a single person,
it is alike impossible to trace it steadily through successive
years.</p>

<p class="flushright p1 small"><span class="sc">Ruskin</span>: “Praeterita.”</p>

<p class="p2">I suppose in a certain sense every brief or retainer
or notice of motion or summons for directions
is an alarum, or alarm, or call to arms; and each
appearance in Court is in the nature of an excursion.
But I had in mind in choosing my title some of those
occasions on which I was called away from the usual
routine of my work to take up other affairs in some
different part of the world.</p>

<p>And casting my glances back to my early days at
the Bar, I remember, as though it were a fact in
another person’s life, that I could never keep away
from an election if there was one about, though I can
be honestly thankful to-day that my young ambition
to be one of the principals in such a contest was never
granted to me.</p>

<p>One of the most stirring elections I played a part
in was in the autumn of 1886, when I went down to
Bristol to help Mr. Joseph Weston, to whom I
acted as a sort of political secretary during the
three weeks preceding the election. I am not
<!--Page 172--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
sure that I was not a corrupt practice or at least an
illegal expense within the meaning of the Act, for
no return was made about me in the election
expenses. But I was really not a fighting unit, being
only a personal intelligence department for Mr.
Weston, and I sat in his drawing-room, which was
papered with sketches and drawings of William
Müller, many of which are now in public galleries,
and there I watched the progress of the game, made
notes of speeches, wrote letters, held conferences
with my chief, and in leisure moments studied the
methods of one of the greatest water-colour painters
of the English School.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Weston, as he afterwards became, was
a well-known and popular citizen. Born in 1822,
he had, with his father before him, been engaged in
the hardware and iron trades. He was connected
with big concerns in his own city and Birmingham,
such as the Bristol Wagon Works and the Patent
Nut and Bolt Company, and politically might be
described as a sound but not an advanced Liberal.
His life had been business not politics, and he had not
given any great amount of thought to the questions
of the hour. He had been Mayor of Bristol for four
successive years, and always treated every class and
creed of citizen with lavish hospitality. It was
rumoured that he would have been member for the
city before its division into districts, but for an
untoward incident arising during his mayoralty,
which, though merely prompted by his natural
hospitality and kindness of heart, was misunderstood
<!--Page 173--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
by those who had to consider its legal parliamentary
bearings. Mr. Samuel Morley, who had been
member since 1868, was desirous of retiring for
reasons of health, and the local association interviewed
two candidates. The first was an eminent
counsel of the Western Circuit. He, with Gladstone
bag and the true faith in him, came down
from London, gave the deputation a sound political
oration at his hotel, and with incorruptible correctness
bade them good evening. The deputation
then walked across to the Town Hall, where they
were received by Mr. Weston, who told them
in a few words his short and simple creed. This
over, he said with a sigh of relief: “Now,
gentlemen, politics are done with, and I am
once more the Mayor of the City, and as I have
never allowed any deputation to go away from the
Town Hall without entertainment, I can make no
exception of yourselves.” The doors were thrown
open and they sat down to a princely supper.</p>

<p>Sad to say, when this reached the ears of the
eminent London counsel and his legal friends in high
places in the party, their formal minds saw in the
kindly Mayor’s thoughtful hospitality the possibility
of future trouble in Election Courts. The fact that
the same evening or early next morning the
association had unanimously selected Mr. Weston
as their candidate, did not seem to weigh with
them against his dangerous act of playing the good
Samaritan to possible voters. A way out of the
difficulty was found by persuading Mr. Samuel
<!--Page 174--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
Morley not to resign, and in 1885 Mr. Weston’s chance
came, when he was assigned the South Division of
Bristol, rightly regarded from a Liberal point of
view as the one doubtful proposition of the election.</p>

<p>Mr. Weston was certainly one of the most generous
of men. There was nothing grudging or of
necessity about his donations, he was in heart and
aspect a cheerful giver. He had a special secretary
to investigate cases of distress and keep the accounts
of his subscriptions, and it was really a matter of
sorrow to him that during the election he had to
keep his hands out of his pockets and close his ears
to local appeals for fear of committing some breach
of election rules. He had always been in favour of
Disestablishment, and though this was not really an
important issue at this election, the drum ecclesiastical
was beaten through the streets of Bedminster,
and a serious clerical campaign was entered upon
against him. With priestly tact a sermon was
preached against Mr. Weston in one of the churches
which had been enriched by his gift. If I remember
right, the present had been the very pulpit from
which the clerical election bomb was hurled. The
incident created a good deal of stir. It is curious
what small things influence the course of an election.
That sermon, the output of sincere, weak-minded,
unbusinesslike enthusiasm, preached probably to a
regular Tory-voting congregation, where there was
no possibility of gaining votes, became a valuable
electioneering asset to Mr. Weston’s friends. He
himself got many letters from fellow-citizens opposed
<!--Page 175--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
to him in politics regretting the affair, but I do not
recall that he ever referred to it in public himself.</p>

<p>And when I look back on those nights and days
of anxious work, the crowded meetings, the weary
conferences, the dull round of deputations, and then
the final shoutings, booings, or applause of the result,
followed by speeches of triumph or manly resignation,
I wonder there are men always forthcoming
to face the cost and trouble of it. What reward
did Weston get from it other than vanity and
vexation of spirit? But when we were in the thick
of the thing on Wednesday, November 25, 1885,
no thoughts of the triviality of the affair ever entered
our minds. The eyes of Bristol were upon us and
the eyes of the Empire were on Bristol, and we were
all intoxicated by the unwonted limelight. Men,
women and children, horses, donkeys and dogs wore
red or blue favours, and one gallant Tory paraded the
streets in a sky-blue suit, and to the delight of all
parties had dyed his dog the same colour. It was
after half-past twelve at night before the result was
announced. We were waiting on the first floor of a
little greengrocer’s shop opposite the local police
station. There had been many false alarms. A
huge crowd surged beneath us, cheering and groaning
other results. At length our figures flashed out in
a transparency across the street:</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="left">Weston</td><td class="rightt">4217</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Hill</td><td class="rightt">4121</td></tr>

</table>

<p><!--Page 176--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
One half of Bedminster went mad with joy, the
other half booed and groaned as though hope had
departed from their lives. Mr. Weston was whirled
away in his brougham to make a round of his
constituency and I went forth to see the fun, for
Bristol on an election night had in those days
something of the Eatanswill spirit left. There was
window-breaking going forward in one of the main
streets and a few police sallies, and later on, well
after one o’clock, when I reached an open square,
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach or one of his friends was
addressing a large and enthusiastic mob from the
windows of the Royal Hotel. “Who’s in for the
South?” shouted someone. “Weston,” came the
answer from hundreds of voices, and prolonged groans
followed the announcement. There were but few
police in the streets, and the mob was orderly enough
and well content to shout over its solitary Conservative
success, when a sound of counter-cheers
approached from the south, and as it came nearer the
cry went up “Weston! Weston!” He was boxed
up in his neat single brougham. I could not see him
from where I stood, but I could see the stalwarts of
his party, a lot of sturdy fellows who had tied ropes
to it, and were pushing and pulling it along or sitting
on the roof and cheering as they rocked their way
into the square. It was the brougham’s last night
out, but it was a glorious one. As it neared the
Royal Hotel this delirious procession became a cause
of offence to the rival crowd. As if with one movement,
they turned on the advancing carriage, and it
<!--Page 177--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
looked as if there would be a faction fight worthy of
the Emerald Isle, in which Weston was bound to be
injured. But a wonderful manœuvre prevented it.
From some ambush sprang to light about a hundred
police. They made their way to their beloved
Mayor, surrounding his carriage and sufficient men
to pull it. This solid wedge of police drove itself
through the crowd to the bottom of Clifton Hill, and
there the carriage was sent on its way with a few
police, and the main body suddenly turned across the
street and blocked the crowd back. It was a smart
piece of work, and the mob gave the police a most
complimentary groan when they saw how they were
outwitted. In this way, in November, 1885,
Weston, M.P., came to his house in Clifton, full of
the joy and glory of victory. But in the summer
of 1886 it was entirely the other way, the cheers
were for our opponents and the tears were ours.
Then Mr. Weston received a knighthood from Mr.
Gladstone for his services to his country, and his
political career was at an end.</p>

<p>But the alarum came to me from another part of
the world altogether at the next general election. I
was at Lancaster Sessions when a telegram called me
to Aylesbury to act as agent for Mr. C. D. Hodgson,
who had pluckily gone down to fight a Rothschild
for Gladstone and Home Rule. We had only a
fortnight to do it in&mdash;&#8203;but what a fortnight! I
travelled right up from Lancaster to Willesden, and
across from there to Westbourne Park, catching the
last train to Aylesbury, and found myself late at
<!--Page 178--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
night in command of a big empty house with tables
and chairs and pens and ink, and a fine band of
voluntary workers. It was many nights before I got
a sleep in bed. It was real campaigning. Everything
had to be done in no time. It was a big
straggling division without any railway, but we
planned to have a meeting in every village and
carried out our plans, pushing our forces over the
Chilterns to the little village of Totternhoe, the rural
silence of whose common was for the first time disturbed
by political speech. Indeed, we were a
thought too active. For our only hope of any
success&mdash;&#8203;and that a slender one&mdash;&#8203;lay in the fact that
at the last election feeling had run so high between
the supporters of Liberal and Conservative that
open fights had taken place, and the Conservatives
had declared they would never vote for a Rothschild.
If the Conservatives had held aloof it would have
been an interesting fight. However, the Union had
to be saved, our rebellion was taken seriously, a
four-lined whip went out to all the blues, and they
flocked to the ballot against us and we were routed.</p>

<p>It was during this election that I first learned
something of the iniquity of imprisonment for debt.
I was told that in a certain village a tradesman could
command some two hundred votes, and that it
would be well to appoint him a chairman of a local
committee. I went over to interview him. He was
very shy, and seemed diffident about Home Rule and
afraid of the Catholics, but after a lot of talk he said
he would vote for Hodgson and use his influence in
<!--Page 179--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
the village in our favour if he took the chair at our
meeting. All this was arranged, but I could not
imagine why such a miserable, mean, uneducated,
narrow-minded little person should be a leader of
enlightened thought, even in a Buckinghamshire
village. I was asking one of our supporters in
Aylesbury, a shrewd, keen man of business, about
my little friend, and he opened my eyes as to the
nature of his influence.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right,” he said. “He’s got the votes
right enough. He’s two hundred of them on his
books.”</p>

<p>“On his books,” I said in surprise, not understanding
what he meant.</p>

<p>“Yes. He gives pretty wide credit. The whole
village is on his books, and half of them are under
judgment summonses. He don’t put them in prison,
of course, but they know he could do.”</p>

<p>I expressed my view about the iniquity of such
proceedings, which I scarcely credited.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything wrong in it,” continued
my friend. “It’s checkmate to the parson. The
parsons about here threaten a labourer with hell in
the next world if he votes Liberal, and our friend
threatens him with hell in this, if he votes Conservative,
and then he votes as he likes. It seems to
me reasonable enough.”</p>

<p>It is curious how far removed this neighbourhood
was from London and the political world. The
workers listened eagerly to speeches from wagons
and in schoolrooms, but the questions discussed were
<!--Page 180--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
evidently new to most of the hearers. Many strange
questions were asked you, and curious ideas of the
position of affairs put forward. One of the strangest
politicians I ever met was an old farm labourer
tramping towards Hughenden. I jumped out of my
pony cart and walked with him up the hill.</p>

<p>“Are you a voter in the Aylesbury Division?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Aye, that I be,” he replied with a grin, in a
chanting voice.</p>

<p>“I hope you are going to vote for Mr. Hodgson.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I be going to vote for Mr. Hodgson right
enough, fur he be Gladstone’s man.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” I said, “he’s Gladstone’s
man.”</p>

<p>“We know a bit about them politics down here,”
he continued, in a monotonous sing-song. “You
see Disraeli he lived down Hughenden way. They
made him Lord Beaconsfield, and he’s buried over
yon. We was very proud of him, we was.”</p>

<p>I began to think there was a blunder somewhere,
and said: “But Hodgson is Gladstone’s man, you
know.”</p>

<p>“All right, I understand, I understand,” he said,
rather testily. “I told you we know all about them
things here. When Disraeli was alive, why, him and
Gladstone lived like brothers, didn’t they? And I
say now one’s dead, vote for t’other.”</p>

<p>It seemed useless to disturb the comfortable and
convenient myth that the old gentleman had built
round the only two names in the political world he
<!--Page 181--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
had ever heard of. We were at the top of the hill,
and our ways parted. I once more assured him that
Hodgson was Gladstone’s man, and bade him
farewell.</p>

<p>And I call to mind a very different excursion from
these political ones, for I little thought when I went
down in early life to the assizes at Norwich that I
should ever have the honour of presiding in the
wonderful old court there. It is certainly one of the
least convenient for its purpose of any that I have
ever seen. There are the most mysterious collection
of pens and pulpits in its interior, which from the
crow’s nest in which the judge sits seem to have been
designed specially to prevent anyone getting from
one to the other when it is necessary to do so. It
took twenty-five minutes to get a jury collected,
seated in the right pen and duly sworn. To my
Manchester mind this was a long pause in my day’s
work, but there is more time to the hour in Norfolk
than in most places, and once you get there, there
really is no hurry. The witness-box in that court is
of very peculiar design. It is built like a sentry box.
The witness enters it from behind; a special verger
or usher shuts him in, and he stays there until
released. I watched a quaint comedy or rather
farce in which a jovial horse-dealer of very ample
proportions played the leading part. With great
difficulty he was got into the witness-box and the
door closed by a clever wrist movement of the usher.
It is true some of him overlapped the bar in front,
but the rest of him was actually in the box and the
<!--Page 182--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
door closed. All would have gone well if counsel for
the defence had not made him laugh&mdash;&#8203;when he must
have expanded, and click! bang! the door flew open,
and we had to wait until the irate usher slowly
awakened, strolled down the corridor, and got him
pressed in again and shut the door. This went on
two or three times, to the great discontent of the
usher, who at last set his back to the door and kept
the fat horse-dealer in by sheer force. What would
have happened if the back door of the box had been
left open I do not know, but I think it might have
hurt the usher’s feelings to suggest it, so I kept
silence.</p>

<p>I was sitting there for my brother, Judge Addison,
K.C., who had recently been appointed, and
was ill and had asked me to sit for him, which as I
had a holiday I was very ready to do. It was my
first experience of travelling to little country towns,
and in those days, when there were no motors and
the railways were very slow and inconvenient, it was
anything but a pleasant task. I remember in the
County Club, which gave me a kindly hospitality, a
genial, well-built, jolly squire, who knew what my
job was, asked me how the working class of the
North compared with the men I met in the courts
round Norfolk. I made answer to the effect that the
Northerners were quicker and sharper, perhaps, but,
then, the Norfolk people had a quaint mother wit.
“But,” I added, “either of them can tell you what
isn’t true occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he cried, “liars! Of course, they’re liars!
<!--Page 183--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
That’s nothing. They are all Radicals and Dissenters
about here!”</p>

<p>I have often wondered how my good friend
Judge Willis, K.C., got on with the Norfolk squire
when he was appointed to that circuit.</p>

<p>The difference between the Manchester ways of
thought and those of Norfolk were very marked, and
so were their methods of business. At one place
a solicitor began quoting some law from a book, when
his opponent got up indignantly and said it was a
well-understood local custom that if a solicitor was
going to bring a law book, he should give notice
to the other side. I agreed that it was a very proper
custom, and impounded the law book, feeling strongly
that if there was any advantage in the possession of
the law book it should be with the Court.</p>

<p>The case went on very well without any law, as it
was a running-down case and a not unamusing one.
A local ruffian had hired a pony and cart and gone
to Sheringham to collect his father’s rents. He took
two friends with him, and they seemed to have
drunk the rents and smashed up the trap and lamed
the pony. The ruffian was a humorist, very stolid
and slow, with an added falsetto of his own to the
long, drawling Norfolk speech which seemed to
amuse the people in court greatly. Neither solicitor
could make anything of him, so I thought I would
try my hand on him.</p>

<p>“Now, how did the accident happen?” I asked
sternly.</p>

<p>“Nay, I doan’t know. I was ’elping to put pony
<!--Page 184--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
back i’ sharves. I doan’t know how ’e got out. I
think belly band broke.”</p>

<p>“But you must know something about it.”</p>

<p>“Na&mdash;&#8203;ay,” drawled the witness. “I worn’t
driving; Bill wor driving.”</p>

<p>“Then if you remember nothing about it, were
you drunk?”</p>

<p>“Me drunk?” asked the witness in pained
surprise. “What, me drunk! Na-ay, I wor no
more drunk nor your lordship.”</p>

<p>There was a titter, promptly suppressed, but the
witness stared blankly at the crowd without a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Well, what was Bill doing while you were putting
the pony in?”</p>

<p>“Bill!” A long pause of thought. “Oh, Bill!
’E wor sittin i’ ’edge looking on.”</p>

<p>“Was Bill drunk?”</p>

<p>“What, Bill drunk? Na-ay, ’e wor no more
drunk nor your lordship.”</p>

<p>A second and more prolonged titter.</p>

<p>“Well, what was the other man doing?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Jim. Let me see. Jim wor
lying on ’is back in the road. Some boys got ’old
of ’im and began draggin’ ’im by the ’eels round
the common. ’E wor a bit drunk, ’e wor.”</p>

<p>“Very drunk, I should say,” commented the
Court severely.</p>

<p>“Na-ay,” dissented the witness with deep seriousness.
“Na-ay, I doan’t think so. It was sea air
<!--Page 185--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
that upset Jim. ’E’d been to Sheringham, and
Jim ’e ain’t used to sea air.”</p>

<p>Everyone in court laughed loud at this excuse,
except the witness and the Court, and of the two the
witness was far the better actor at keeping an
impassive face.</p>

<p>Many strange stories were told of Addison’s predecessor,
the late Judge Price, who seems to have been
a second Crompton Hutton in his methods of
administering justice. I got a vivid glimpse of his
system at one of the courts I visited. It was held in
a little country town in a big barn-like building.
The judge robed in a caretaker’s house. Then we
formed a procession, the judge and the registrar
being preceded by a policeman and a yellow dog, his
property. It was rather like going to be hanged
without a chaplain. We crossed a brick-paved yard
and walked up the centre of a crowded building.
A conjuror had been there the night before, and the
judge sat on a daïs of packing cases covered with
green baize. These keggled whenever the witnesses
came up. The plaintiff stood on an auctioneer’s
rostrum, and the defendant sat on a common
Windsor chair. Whenever a case was called on the
Registrar got up and called out, “All witnesses
leave the court.” No one moved, and the policeman
and the dog strolled round the building and selected
witnesses. These he threw out with very little
trouble, but it was an undignified proceeding, and
wasted a lot of time. I could see that I should spend
the rest of the day in the place, and probably miss
<!--Page 186--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
the last train if I did not move. So I sent for the
Registrar, a worthy gentleman of the old school, and
told him my views.</p>

<p>“I don’t want all the witnesses out of court,” I
said.</p>

<p>“The late judge always had them out of court,
your Honour.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but I don’t think it’s necessary, and
it wastes time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Honour, but the late judge always had
the witnesses out of court,” repeated the Registrar.</p>

<p>“Well, I must ask you not to order them out of
court to-day. It takes a long time to get them out,
and longer still to get them back again.”</p>

<p>There was a note of contempt in the Registrar’s
voice as he replied, “The late judge never had the
witnesses back, your Honour.”</p>

<p>I felt that I was in the presence of a procedure
invented by a judicial genius.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE COMPLEAT CITIZEN</h4>

<p class="small"><span class="decoration">Question.</span> What is thy duty towards thy Neighbour?</p>
<p class="p0 small"><span class="decoration">Answer.</span> My duty towards my Neighbour, is to love him as
myself, and to do to all men, as I would they should do unto me.</p>

<p class="flushright p1 small">A Catechism. “Book of Common Prayer.”</p>

<p class="p2">Until each of us faithfully fulfils the first clause
of his duty to his neighbour it seems unlikely that
we shall see in the flesh a manifestation of the
compleat citizen. I prefer the old-fashioned phrase
to the modern slang of super-citizen, but I take it
the idea of our seventeenth-century fathers was
much the same as ours, only they knew enough
English to express it in their own tongue.</p>

<p>And one naturally goes back for a motto for
citizenship to Dr. Nowel, sometime dean of the
cathedral church of St. Paul, who, “like an honest
Angler, made that good, plain, unperplexed Catechism
which is printed with our good old Service-book.”
For, if anyone wished to study the evolution
of citizenship in this country, he would, I think,
for past history read the records of that ancient
community of citizens that dwelt in the old days
east of Temple Bar, though for the modern evidence
of the continued existence of citizenship he would
<!--Page 188--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
have of necessity to journey towards the rugged
north. For if there is one thing that stands out as
typical of the north countryman of to-day, it is his
pride of citizenship. Just as Paul boasted of
Tarsus when he was away from his native Cilicia,
so the Manchester man, away from Lancashire, the
Leeds man far from Yorkshire, or the Newcastle
man dreaming of his beloved Northumberland, can
always remember that he too is a citizen of no
mean city.</p>

<p>There is no widespread sense of citizenship in
London. It exists sporadically, no doubt. The
germs of it must be there, but the thing itself fell
with the City walls, and passed away with the
destruction of the last gate. No doubt it will grow
and flourish anew, and perhaps the foundations even
now are being laid on the south bank of the Thames
opposite Westminster. But even in Doctor
Johnson’s day the thing itself was not. Lover of
London as he was&mdash;&#8203;and not even Boswell had a
finer <em>gust</em> for the great city&mdash;&#8203;you find him
claiming for his beloved that she was pre-eminent
in learning and science, and that she possessed the
best shops in the world, but he does not assert
these things with the pride of a citizen. No!
London to the great man is a “heaven upon
earth,” and in those very words he negatives the
idea of citizenship, for to be a citizen is to be a part
proprietor, having a voice in the management of the
concern and a responsibility for its industry and
good behaviour. Citizenship means freedom and
<!--Page 189--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
the exercise of a franchise and the privileges
belonging to a peculiar city. Pious visions of
heaven give no hint of such things. And though
London was and is all that Doctor Johnson claims,
it is as much the property of the foreigner as of the
denizen. Boswell had as great a share in it as his
friend, and in truth neither had more than an
equitable title to be called Londoner.</p>

<p>There is indeed no possibility of a citizen in
London being in any real sense a compleat citizen.
The pictures in his galleries, the trees and flowers
in his parks, the statues in his streets, are not
really his at all. In London if a new road is cut
across the grass of the park a few murmurs may
reach the ears of some remote official through the
pages of the Press, but they cause him no uneasiness.
Did such an affair awaken the indignation of the
citizens of Manchester, meetings would be held,
debates raised, and in the City Council the head of
the official would be demanded by the malcontents,
or at least a resolution moved to disallow his
salary on the estimates. People who have not
been citizens of any of the great towns of the North
can have but little idea of the keen interest taken
in municipal matters. In London day by day one
scarcely reads a word in the Press of the great
problems of civic administration which are so
important to health and happiness. Gas and
water are regarded with light-hearted contempt
unless the services break down, when the simple
Londoner engages in futile summer correspondence
<!--Page 190--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
dear to the heart of editors in want of copy. The
gas and water and electricity, like the pictures and
parks, are not his to manage. But the citizen of
no mean city sees the great committees of his
parliament fighting as to who shall serve him at
least cost and at the same time make the noblest
contributions towards the rates. When the New
Zealander rediscovers this island and digs up the
engineering works of our time to read papers about
them to his historical society, he will find the great
cities of the North bringing their water from the
mountains of Cumberland and Wales, Manchester,
Liverpool and Birmingham linked to Thirlmere,
Vyrnwy and Rhayader; but he will have to peck
about in the clay a long time before he finds any
vestiges of the little troughs in which they store
their water hereabouts. That Thirlmere scheme
was, I think, typical of Manchester and north-country
citizenship. There you had up against
you the whole sentiment of the indolent holiday
makers, the landed proprietors and the average
man in the street who is of no city, headed by that
honest prophet and champion of lost causes, John
Ruskin. But citizenship was there, and citizenship
won. And it is always to me one of the crosses
of life that John Ruskin never had a good word
for Manchester, though Manchester returned good
for evil by gathering together, after he had gone,
the most beautiful and thoughtful collection to
illustrate his works and days. No one asserts that
Manchester is the Good and the Beautiful exemplified,
<!--Page 191--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
but the author of “Fors Clavigera” ought to
have seen a sense of beauty in a community manifesting
itself in the perfection of outward and
visible cleanliness, comfort and health, and a daily
raising of the standard of living. The purity of
life is higher in the great cities of the North than in
many rural villages which look so peaceful and
beautiful. Slum conditions are not unknown in
the background of the garden of England, where
life seems on the surface to be roses, roses, all the
way. And the only antidote to all these evils that
I can foresee is the growth of that spirit of citizenship
which is of so little account in the South either
in town or country, but which seems to be struck
out of the very granite setts by the hoofs of the
lurry horses when they haul the cotton bales along
the Manchester streets.</p>

<p>And although I can only lay claim to have been
a citizen by adoption, yet on one or two occasions
I got whirled into the midst of a local fight, and
as Yuba Bill would say, “waded in with the best.”
And it was one of the curious features of Manchester
that, in the very shortest period, she finds a
place for the foreigner and whistles him on to her
deck, and there he is pulling the ropes and working
the windlass like a native born. Yiddish, German,
Greek, Albanian, Turk, Spaniard, Scot, Irish, and
even the intractable Celt or Silurian from remote
Wales may live in Manchester and even continue
to speak their native tongues, but surely and by
no means slowly, they are kneaded into the citizen
<!--Page 192--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
mass of municipal dough, and may even be chosen
as plums for the pudding or be selected as that
decorative sprig of civic glory which we stick at
the top of the affair and worship for twelve months
as My Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>And a merry encounter I had with the powers
that be&mdash;&#8203;it is deemed an honourable thing to set
the shoulders of the Corporation on the ground in
a fair bout&mdash;&#8203;and I recall it with greater pleasure
because it was the last time I appeared as an
advocate. It was my last brief, as it were, and
Cerberus-like I was the solicitor, the counsel and
the client&mdash;&#8203;three single gentlemen rolled into one&mdash;&#8203;and
what was more, I won my case. And it was
not, as you may be thinking, a mere police-court
affair, I had not been riding my bicycle on the
footpath, my dog had not strayed round the corner
in undress and met a policeman&mdash;&#8203;why do dogs
without collars meet policemen? a mad dog never
does&mdash;&#8203;nor had I been watering the garden in the
summer when the Corporation annually arrange to
be short of water. No; as a matter of fact, I was
not the defendant. I was the prosecutor, and I
was prosecuting the Corporation for conspiracy to
annoy certain peaceful residents of Withington,
including myself. And as in this comic-opera
constitution of ours when a Corporation annoys you,
you arraign them before themselves, it is something
to have achieved to have prosecuted a Town
Council successfully before themselves, and to have
found a Town Council brave and honest enough
<!--Page 193--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
to convict themselves and promise not to do it
again.</p>

<p>It arose in this way. When I found that I
really was a Manchester citizen and was going to
live there for ever and ever, as I hoped, I made
up my mind to buy a home of my own, and I
settled on a corner house at the back of Withington
village, bounded on one side by a narrow street
called Brunswick Road, and on the other by another
narrow street called Burlington Road. They were
paved by setts, as all the Manchester streets are,
but even the setts had a peaceful old-world aspect,
and so little traffic was there over them that the grass
sprang up between them, just as the history books
tell us it used to do all over England before the
repeal of the Corn Laws. Beyond the house were
fields with potatoes in them and ponds to slide on
in the winter, and there was a little stream at the
end of Heaton Road, whose presiding naïad collected
old domestic china in parts and left them
carelessly lying on her bed. Then there was that
ideal school for children at Ladybarn House, with
a playground to which you could stroll and watch
really great cricket matches, and marvel at the self-detachment
of a young lady of eight who could
field long-stop and make a surreptitious daisy chain
at the same time. Once a year, indeed, there was
a large but orderly crowd at the annual athletic
sports. One policeman kept it in excellent order.
The sport was of a high class, and you could watch
a future “blue,” literally a three-year-old, romping
<!--Page 194--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
home in the kindergarten race, for which he had
been laboriously trained by his elder sisters on a
neighbouring lawn.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not to be expected that this
sylvan retreat could remain for ever. The builder
was bound to steal the fields from the potatoes.
The North-Western Railway had obtained powers
to make its way across to Parr’s Wood, and bought
out the cuckoos that they might not jeer at the
engine-drivers and madden them to striking pitch
with their call of the summer. But you cannot
expect a cuckoo to keep faith, and only last year I
heard them again from my bedroom window&mdash;&#8203;and
if you will be hospitable to birds, as Manchester
folk can be, and make a feast of fat and cocoanut
in the garden, I know no place where birds are more
ready to return your call without ceremony. We
had many generations of thrushes born in our little
garden, and starlings, blackbirds, robins and tomtits
would build with us on occasion, and would
drop in promiscuous-like all through the day.</p>

<p>Some who know the place of which I write, may
think that there is a note of exaggeration in my
description. I am ready to agree that at no time
was the hinterland of Withington a mere fairyland
of milk and honey and green pastures and still
waters, but it had certain attributes of homeliness
and peace and quiet that make me remember it with
the gratitude due from one whose lines had fallen
in pleasant places.</p>

<p>It was this retreat of hard-working citizens that
<!--Page 195--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
the Corporation sought to destroy without warning
or consultation, and if it had not been that I found
practically every resident of my own way of thinking
and spoiling for a fight, I think they would have
successfully ruined the district.</p>

<p>It was a summer morning, and a Sunday at that,
when we woke up to the fact that the motor ’buses
were careering along our narrow roads back and
front of the house. They came hurtling over the
setts at the rate of about six an hour, and as you
heard them chirruping in the distance and screaming
near to you and experienced the trail of stench they
left along their way, and saw the pavements and
side-walks splattered with mud, it was clear that if
they had come to stay, those of us who could afford
would have to go.</p>

<p>But why had the motor ’bus invaded us in this
way? The answer was easily given. A company, the
chairman of which was a powerful town councillor,
had obtained licences to run ’buses along these side
roads from Levenshulme to Stretford. They were
to run by these back ways because the Council had
trams on the main route, and did not want the
company or competition of the ’buses. No doubt
the end of August had been chosen to start the
’buses, because in a residential district like ours
everyone was away for the holidays. I was just
going off to Grasmere, and telling my solicitor to
threaten the company with an action for nuisance,
I fired a letter into the papers and went my way.
To my delight I found that the whole neighbourhood
<!--Page 196--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
was up in arms, and although I grudged the
holiday time given up to it, I went into the fight with
considerable gusto. There was the usual newspaper
correspondence. We dilated on the amenities of
Withington and pointed out that the only traffic
really catered for was the Sunday <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ-fide</i>
traveller, and asked why one lucky councillor
should have these licences given him when the rest
of such traffic was run by the Corporation for the
ratepayers. The reply was made that we were a
lot of selfish people&mdash;“carriage people” we were
generally called&mdash;&#8203;who lived luxurious days in
glorious country, which we wished to keep to ourselves,
and that this company of motor ’buses had
been mainly formed in the interest of the working
man, who desired to ruralise among us.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this clash of words we organised
a petition, and the other side did the same. It was
clear that we had the residents, who were nearly
all of them workers in the city of various grades,
entirely with us. We had a very strong case on
these two points alone. First, that the type of ’bus
used by the company was undesirable, and secondly,
that the roads over which it ran were unsuitable.
The other side had a strong case, in that temporary
licences were already granted, and the Corporation
were not likely to go back on a matter they had just
decided. Further, the eminent councillor at the
head of the company had many supporters in the
Town Council, including the Lord Mayor, and
Withington was a district recently added to
<!--Page 197--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
Manchester, and not much in touch as yet with
Council affairs. Before we carried our petition to
the Council, in clubs and places where they wager,
the betting was three or four to one against us, but
I am conceited enough to chronicle that after the
hearing it dropped to evens.</p>

<p>I confess that it was so long since I had played
the advocate that it was with some trepidation that
I briefed myself to appear in my own interests at the
hearing before the Hackney Coach Sub-Committee.
A large number of residents went with me, and I
stated my own case and theirs. I should like to
report my speech at length. It was a beautiful
speech. But the only phrase I remember was one
in which I demolished the argument that we were
a lot of selfish, stuck-up carriage people by confessing
“that for my part the only carriage I had ever
possessed was a double perambulator, and I thought
most of my neighbours held the same record.”</p>

<p>As a Manchester citizen I should have liked to
have to chronicle a more speedy judgment, but historical
accuracy compels me to say that Wilmslow,
Levenshulme, Altrincham, and Urmston all took
steps to protect the amenities of their roads before
Manchester. It was not before October 8 that
the committee refused to continue the licences.
Still, we could boast that in six short weeks the residents
of our little oasis had risen in rebellion against
our rulers and governors and convinced them of the
error of their ways.</p>

<p>A friend of mine on the Town Council used to
<!--Page 198--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
tease me a good deal about the beauties of the
Withington District. He lived in lovely far off
country himself, and had only visited Withington
as a member of the Highways Committee.</p>

<p>“It seems an ordinary enough sort of place,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Let me remind you of what Wordsworth says,”
I replied.</p>

<p>You can always obtain the just rude word to end
a discussion from Wordsworth’s poems or David’s
Psalms&mdash;&#8203;David is perhaps a little heavy handed for
these days.</p>

<p>I suppose it is because my forefathers lived on the
marches that I cannot help enjoying a downright
good fight. I know it is wicked to enjoy the angry
scenes of a contest, but even the saintly John Henry
Newman confesses on occasions to have had “his
monkey up”&mdash;&#8203;not a very fierce and vicious monkey,
but sufficient of a monkey as a precedent for a poor
pagan to refer to&mdash;&#8203;and when you get a wilderness
of monkeys up, as we did in the Battle of the Sites,
then is there a scene for Homer’s pen.</p>

<p>So did every man, woman and child in the
city get whirled into the contest and rush into
<!--Page 199--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
the flood, and get carried out of their depths
and find themselves very much at sea. But it
<em>was</em> a fight.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Sites was only a glorious incident
in the thirty years’ war that in Manchester had
been steadily raging round the affair of the Royal
Infirmary. And I am far from suggesting that the
good individuals who were members of the Board
of the Infirmary were any worse citizens than the
rest of us. But such is human nature that the
action of a board or committee is not the action of
the individuals. A sort of lowest common moral
denominator is found by consent of all, and that
becomes the ruling quantity in the resultant action.
When a good man makes a mistake he apologises and
makes amends. Had any individual member of the
Infirmary Board done some of the things that were
done by him collectively, I have never doubted that
when the wrong was pointed out he would have
hastened to straighten things out. But a board
or committee never apologises, neither does it pay
the costs when judgment goes against it. Those
come out of the estate.</p>

<p>And I wish I could believe the theory of Cardinal
Newman, who solemnly tells us in his “Apologia”:
“Also, besides the hosts of evil spirits, I considered
there was a middle race, [Greek: daimonia]δαιμονια, neither in heaven
nor in hell; partially fallen, capricious, wayward;
noble or crafty, benevolent or malicious, as the
case might be. These beings gave a sort of inspiration
or intelligence to races, nations, and classes of
<!--Page 200--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
men. Hence the action of bodies politic and associations,
which is often so different from that of the
individuals who compose them.” It is a charming
conceit, but if taken literally might lead to committees
throwing all responsibilities for their delinquencies
upon the little demons at their elbows. But I like
to imagine and picture the scene of a board meeting
with [Greek: daimonia]δαιμονια in attendance, painted in the manner
of the younger Teniers, whose goblins, teasing the
unhappy Dives, have cheered me since early boyhood.
Certainly if there were any smaller devils
taking part in Infirmary affairs, which seems a practical
solution of many difficult problems, they were
not wise devils&mdash;&#8203;indeed, they were silly devils&mdash;&#8203;and
we did well to cast them out.</p>

<p>When the new Infirmary was building in the
Oxford Road, I happened to meet Mr. Charles
Hopkinson, who deserves so well of the citizens for
his careful and devoted work on the Building
Committee. He was admiring the rapidly rising
building, and I told him that I did not see anything
of those two pedestals in the front gardens.</p>

<p>“What two pedestals?” asked Hopkinson; “I
never heard of any pedestals in the design.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied, “there were to be two
pedestals for the two statues.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a notion what you mean,” answered
Hopkinson, impatiently. “Whose statues?”</p>

<p>“Joseph Bell’s and my own,” I called back over
my shoulder.</p>

<p>And although Hopkinson was quite right, and
<!--Page 201--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
these statues have not been placed there even yet,
still it is only fitting that the great building on the
Oxford Road should have had some memorial of
Bell and myself, for without us there would have
been no Royal Infirmary on the Oxford Road. A
mediæval builder would have expressed in a series
of sculptured capitals the whole history of the Battle
of the Sites, and left satirical portraits of the old
Board in gargoyles hanging over the guttering,
whilst a statue of Joseph Bell would have adorned
a spacious quadrangle, round the walls of which
myself and the others of his committee were
portrayed in brilliant mosaics. But your modern
architect, who would be annoyed at being called a
builder, never puts into his work any of the history
of his building, but is quite content to erect adequate
walls and roof and useful equipment and decorate the
outside, much as a confectioner be-sugars a cake, to
please the eye for the moment rather than with
any intention of expressing ideas in his art. No
doubt the Gothic days are over, and the Gothic
spirit is dead, but Manchester has got what she
wanted, an Infirmary building second to none in
the kingdom.</p>

<p>I always intended to have a return match with
the old Infirmary Board, because, although I won
the first of the rubber, the loss of the game did
not to my mind fall on the shoulders of those who
ought to have borne it.</p>

<p>Early in 1893 a lady sought my advice through
her solicitor. Her story was a very extraordinary
<!--Page 202--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
one. She had been a nurse at the Royal Infirmary
since 1889. Her career was successful. She had
been selected to attend on the late Oliver Heywood,
and up to November of 1892 there had never been
a word of complaint about her work or her conduct.
A small-pox epidemic now broke out in Lymm, in
Cheshire. Another nurse had been sent there and
was ill&mdash;&#8203;it was supposed, of small-pox. My client
was sent there hurriedly to take her place. She
found the so-called small-pox hospital to be two
cottages converted into a temporary hospital, and
her colleague was ill in bed, and was taken away.
There was also a wife of a tramp dying of small-pox,
and eight or ten patients. There was no
water in the house. It is needless to repeat
other unpleasant details of want of equipment.
She stuck to her task for several days; she sat
up with a delirious patient all night, and when
the patient died she had to help the men bring in
the coffin and screw down the lid, it being with much
difficulty, and only after bribes of whisky that
they would come inside the cottages at all. After
writing letters to the authorities in Manchester and
asking the local doctor for help that did not come,
she at length broke down in health and fled. Arrived
at Monsall, she was nursed there for a week, and at
the end of that time received her dismissal without
notice, and was refused permission, though at the
end of her probation, to pass her examinations.</p>

<p>Every effort was made to get the old Board to do
justice to the lady and let her pass her examination,
<!--Page 203--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
but as no redress was to be obtained without
litigation a writ was issued. Under her agreement
the Infirmary Board had no right to send her to
Lymm at all. The lady desired no damages against
the charity, and, therefore, an action was brought
for an order to compel the Board to allow her to take
her examinations. Shee led me in the case, and Gully
and Sutton were for the defendants&mdash;&#8203;and I have no
doubt told them exactly what they thought of
them. Certainly it was with an air of great relief
that Gully, at Mr. Justice Day’s suggestion, threw
up the defence and agreed that the lady should sit
for her examination.</p>

<p>The nurse agreed to compromise on the understanding
that the matter was left in the hands of
the Medical Board, whose examination she successfully
passed. The lady got justice, but the Infirmary
Board did not, and I made up my mind that if I ever
got the chance of a return match with them, they
should not be let off so lightly again.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Sites had started years before
I came to Manchester. The old Board had made
up its mind to rebuild the Infirmary on the old site
in the centre of the city; the majority of the citizens
wished it to go to the present site at Stanley Grove,
which was a gift of the Whitworth Trustees. Of
the jealousies, squabbles, and troubles of all these
years the less said the better.</p>

<p>The old Board, with Fabian genius, continually
prevented any agreement with the University
authorities, and brought any other plan than that
<!--Page 204--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
of rebuilding on the old site to a dilatory end. The
older generations of great citizens who had fought
the Board in the past&mdash;&#8203;Thomas Ashton, Reuben
Spencer, Henry Simon, and Dr. Leech&mdash;&#8203;were no
longer with us, and in 1902 the old Board thought this
was a most excellent time to carry through their pet
scheme. They actually prepared plans for the
rebuilding, and called a meeting, believing that the
opposition had died down.</p>

<p>The one man who defeated their plans was
Joseph Bell. His interests in the commercial world
have been too engrossing to allow him much time
for political work, but from the way he handled the
Infirmary question, I make sure he would be a big
asset to any political party. At the first onslaught
it did not appear that the old Board’s opponents were
very strong, but the meeting stood adjourned. I
had never met Bell, but I received a note from
him, asking for an interview, a letter of mine
having been read at the first meeting. It was
when I was reading his note that I remembered
that, from a dramatic point of view, I had left the
case between the nurse and the Infirmary Board
unfinished.</p>

<p>Joseph Bell came to see me after Court with a
bundle of papers, and, sitting down at my table,
told me the whole story of the Infirmary Board and
their doings on the site question from the earliest
days. Two things were clear; one, that my visitor
had a thorough and intimate knowledge of his
subject, and, two, that he meant business. When
<!--Page 205--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
he had ended his statement he looked at me keenly
and said: “Are you going to help?”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“We are going to clear out the old Board and
build a new infirmary on the Stanley Grove site.”</p>

<p>“You may put it there,” I said, holding out my
hand.</p>

<p>“Then the battle can proceed,” said Joseph Bell,
laughing.</p>

<p>And a very excellent fight it was. I should be
sorry to have to read again all the letters that were
written and speeches that were made. I remember
I had to move the resolution against the old Board
at the Memorial Hall and Lord Derby was in the
chair. I certainly did not forget the nurse case
when I told the members of the old Board that,
“however great my temptations, I would not say
anything worse of them than I knew they often said
of themselves, namely, that they had left undone all
they ought to have done, and had done all they ought
not to have done, and there was no health in them.”
A sentiment I was glad to hear heartily cheered.</p>

<p>We won the resolution, we won the poll the
friends of the old Board demanded, and then we had
an election forced upon us. Joseph Bell’s policy
had been to form a Board by consent, and on his
“ticket” he ran several members of the old Board
who more or less favoured his views. He was
absolutely master of the situation, and could, had
he wished, have nominated his own Board. There
were twenty-two members to be elected, and Bell’s
<!--Page 206--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
committee put up twenty-one. The friends of the
old Board did not understand Bell’s good sense in
taking over so many members of the old Board, and
did their best to thwart any settlement by consent.
An election took place, and certainly created more
interest and feeling than any municipal election that
I can remember. It was with some excitement
that, coming out of Court on the afternoon of the
counting, I bought a paper from a <cite>Chronicle</cite> boy,
who was shouting out “Result of the Infirmary
Poll.” One of Bell’s candidates had resigned at
the last moment, and the other twenty were returned
at the head of the poll.</p>

<p>As I read the successful names I felt a sense of
relief. Something had been attempted and something
done. That nurse case that had begun
before Mr. Justice Day ten years ago was really
finished.</p>

<p>But though the Battle of the Sites was over,
the Battle of what to do with the old Site is not yet
well begun, for having pulled down the old building,
there is a very pretty quarrel going on as to what to
put in its place. And I envy Joseph Bell sniffing
the battle from the upper windows of Portland Street,
where the stricken field&mdash;&#8203;and it is a stricken field&mdash;&#8203;lies
at his doorstep. At the right time he, as a good
Manchester citizen, will off with his coat and rush
into the fray whilst I shall be idling here, with no
right to heave even half a brick in the good cause.
But whoever is on the other side, the stable money
is on Joseph Bell.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THAT REMINDS ME</h4>

<p class="small"><span class="sc">Fluellen</span>: It is not well done, mark you now, to take the

<p class="p2">That reminds me that the little Welshman&mdash;&#8203;and
what race understands the rules of courtesy more
truly&mdash;&#8203;warns us against the ill manners of interrupting
the story of our companion by our own
incomparably wittier jest, until there has been a
fair pause for the courtly reception of his somewhat
antiquated tale, and then, I take it, good breeding
compels us to pretend that out of the ashes of his
dusty reminiscences our own admirable phœnix
has sprung, and we begin our story with “That
reminds me,” not as a boast, but out of mere complaisance.
But when one has only oneself to
interrupt the course is smoother. Nor is it at all
necessary that there should be any real sequence
in the story-telling to justify the phrase. It is a
well-known convention of the game that you may
dash off into a story having no reference to the
past conversation as long as you preface it with
some lip-service to the pleasures of memory. For
the story-telling habit comes down to us, no doubt
<!--Page 208--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
from the East and the “Arabian Nights.” Poor
Scheherazadé had a special reason for being reminded
of a new story at the right moment, she indeed
being the first lady novelist who literally made her
living out of fiction. Really I cannot but think we
should get some brighter and more entertaining
stories from the fair writers of to-day if their novels
were written under a similar stimulus. This habit
of irrelevant story-telling is no new thing&mdash;&#8203;Cervantes
caught it from the East, perhaps, and our own
Fielding glories in it as being part of the method of
the Master; for is not the “History of the Man of the
Hill” a corollary to the “Novell of the Curious Impertinent”?
Dickens no doubt inherited the manner
directly from Fielding, and in his earlier style will
interrupt unblushingly the humours of an evening at
Dingley Dell to narrate the unnecessary clergyman’s
unnecessary narrative of “The Convict’s Return,”
and then, as old Wardle says, “You are fairly in it!”</p>

<p>And having satisfied my petty legal mind with
the precedents in the case, and convinced myself
that irrelevant story-telling is, as the golfer would
say, a fair hazard, I will confess that I should
not have interrupted my narrative with this
particular embarrassing and irrelevant chapter had
I not seen an excellent portrait of Partington
the other day. How many remember that sound
artist? I last heard of him from Sir Henry Irving,
who had seen him in San Francisco&mdash;&#8203;and this picture
of Partington’s reminded me of George Freemantle,
that prince of musical critics, whose picture by the
<!--Page 209--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
same artist still hangs in the Brasenose Club, where
he was so greatly beloved, and that reminded me of
Murphy, Q.C., and that reminded me of the Right
Honourable Arthur James Balfour, and not unnaturally
that reminded me of “The Story of the
Mysterious Barber,” which, as Sir Francis Burnand’s
Mr. Barlow says&mdash;&#8203;as you have not heard, I will
now proceed to relate. And “The Story of the
Mysterious Barber” is in reality the story of the
election petition against Mr. Balfour in 1892.</p>

<p>Now, although this petition was a farce and a
fiasco at that, yet I am far from thinking that, to
those who started it, it was as obviously an ill-advised
a proceeding as it quickly appeared to be in court.
Of course, Mr. Balfour himself desired the election
to be conducted on the purest lines, but, then,
Mr. Balfour by himself probably could not have
succeeded in winning the election. The man who
won the election was Stephen Chesters Thompson,
the uncrowned king of Ardwick, and at the back
of Chesters Thompson was a brewery. In manner
and appearance Chesters Thompson was as genial a
ruffian as ever scuttled a ship, but he had a big heart
and an open hand, and was genuinely fond of
throwing largess to his poorer neighbours. I have
heard that he would enter a grocer’s shop on a Saturday
night or Monday morning, when the women
were paying up their books, and, snatching the books
from their hands with a “Now, missus, I’ll be settling
this for you,” he would pay up all the books and depart
with a jest and a laugh, as though the affair were
<!--Page 210--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
a commonplace pleasantry. He and Mr. Balfour
were, indeed, an ill-assorted pair, but politics makes
one acquainted with strange friends, and no one
ever saw the least impatience exhibited by Mr.
Balfour towards his adjutant. I never heard
Chesters Thompson make a long oration, but I
remember him once at the end of a meeting jumping
up and delivering a panegyric on Mr. Balfour. At
the close of its tawdry, fulsome, and sincere adulation,
which Mr. Balfour bore like a hero, Chesters
Thompson wound up by patting him endearingly
on the shoulder with his heavy paw. “I luve
Arthur James Balfour,” he said, swaying heavily
about with suppressed emotion, and throwing the
whole weight of his devotion into the second syllable
of the word Balfour, which he always accented
thus. “I luve Arthur James Balfour,” he continued,
“and I tell you boys this, that should the day ever
coom that it is necessary, I shall be there to place
the body of Stephen Chesters Thompson between
Arthur James Balfour and the dagger of the
arsarsin.” The cheers that rent the stuffy atmosphere
of the hired schoolroom at this magnificent
sentiment proved that in Ardwick, at least, poetry,
romance, melodrama&mdash;&#8203;call it what you will&mdash;&#8203;was
a living force, and that Chesters Thompson was its
high priest.</p>

<p>With such a general and many lieutenants who
modelled themselves on their leader, it is not to be
wondered at that stories came round bearing the
interpretation of ill-doing. The election was a very
<!--Page 211--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
keenly contested one. Professor Munro, who
fought for the Liberals, put up an excellent fight,
and was only beaten by 398 votes. In August it
was announced that a petition had been lodged by
the defeated candidate. Nothing personal was
alleged against Mr. Balfour, but there were allegations
of illegal practices, bribery, treating, and
general corruption.</p>

<p>What was done between August and November to
collect the necessary evidence I have no idea, but
when the briefs were delivered it was very clear that
it would be a difficult task to prove any of the
allegations that had been made. It was on
November 4 that the case came on before Justices
Cave and Vaughan Williams. Murphy, Q.C.,
Lewis Coward, and myself were for the petitioner,
and Finlay, Q.C., Danckwerts, the Hon. A. Lyttelton,
and Lord Robert Cecil for Mr. Balfour. Murphy,
who was far from well, addressed the Bench sitting
down. We really had no case to open, and those
who had been employed by Professor Munro to
collect facts had, I fear, been carried away by their
enthusiasm and belief in the general iniquity of their
opponents, and had mistaken rumour and hearsay
for evidence. It was a lamentable position for
counsel to be in, but Murphy&mdash;&#8203;if one can predicate
such movements about so genial a man-mountain as
Murphy&mdash;&#8203;skilfully danced among a labyrinth of eggs
with as much certainty and decision as if he were
upon a clear stage.</p>

<p>He spent quite a long time over the various
<!--Page 212--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
matters about which he might or might not satisfy
the Court, and then he paused and said there was
one specific case of bribery which, if the witness was
believed by the Court, would invalidate the election.
The name of the witness was John Francis Green.
Murphy himself had never believed in the fellow,
but he agreed that if when we saw John Francis
Green he turned out to be a witness of truth, then
the petition was well founded.</p>

<p>The mystery of John Francis Green is like the
problem of the “dark lady” in the Sonnets. Some
will believe one thing about it and some another.
The Court refused to believe him at all, and it may
be that he was merely a romancer and a liar. On
the other hand, his story may have been partly built
up from facts relating not necessarily to this election,
but to some municipal or other contest. Certainly
it was an extraordinary story for a man to invent at
the risk of being found guilty of perjury, and with
the necessity of giving up his business in Ardwick.
True, he was to receive £200, but only if he gave
truthful evidence, a not unreasonable arrangement,
as Ardwick would not have held him if the result of
his evidence had been to invalidate the election.</p>

<p>The first day’s evidence was devoted to one case
after another that more or less broke down and
could not be proved. Then we received news that
John Francis Green had disappeared. He had been
ill for some days, and we adjourned without knowing
whether he would turn up or not. The next day he
did turn up, a miserable figure muffled up to the chin
<!--Page 213--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
and looking wretchedly ill. Some said his illness
was mere funk at having to tell his false story in the
witness-box, but there was even then opportunity
to go back and speak the truth. However, he told
his story on oath exactly as he had given it to
Professor Munro’s supporters.</p>

<p>He was a barber in Ardwick, and had many times
shaved Mr. Chesters Thompson. He said that one
of Mr. Balfour’s supporters often came to his shop
and talked to him, and on one occasion gave him £15
and a letter of instructions, and later on a man he
did not know, but who said he was an election agent,
had given him £7. This money Green was to hand
over to people who presented him tickets, and these
tickets he described in great detail. There were
several names on them, and some had sealing-wax
and a ribbon attached to them. After the election
some of the tickets and incriminating letters which
remained with him were, according to Green’s statement,
kept by him in a box, and towards the end of
October his house was broken into and the box
stolen. That in itself was enough to make one disbelieve
his story, but when it was found that he
could not identify any one of Mr. Balfour’s supporters
as the election agent, it was clear that in the absence
of corroboration his evidence must be dismissed as
useless.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy now took the only course open to him,
and said he could not usefully continue the petition.
Mr. Maltby, Mr. Balfour’s agent, Mr. Chesters
Thompson, and others went into the witness-box
<!--Page 214--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
and formally denied all knowledge of Green and his
extraordinary story. The Court adjourned until the
afternoon to deliver judgment, and I took Murphy
up to the Brasenose Club.</p>

<p>It was about noon, the club was empty, and
Murphy reclined on a sofa, and disappeared behind
the <cite>Times</cite>. Very soon the paper boys began to yell out
“Kerlapse of the Pertition!” “Kerlapse of the Pertition!”
I knew I should have to stand much chaff
and friendly abuse over the petition, as in all clubs
where there are no politics eighty per cent. of the
members were Tory, and it is only the remainder who
must not indulge in political discussion. And sure
enough, in rushed Freemantle, the musical critic,
waving a paper and calling out to me, “Here’s nice
work! Here’s a disgraceful affair to be connected
with! Apart from politics altogether, did you ever
read of such a wicked and abominable conspiracy to
destroy a political opponent? Of course, I know you
have had nothing to do with it, but I should just like
to be face to face with the ruffian who put this
wretched case forward!”</p>

<p>“You shall,” I said, and pulling down the <cite>Times</cite>
I disclosed my learned leader and introduced him to
Freemantle. “Mr. Murphy&mdash;&#8203;Mr. Freemantle.” As
I strolled away I felt Murphy was shaking with gentle
laughter to a running accompaniment of Freemantle’s
explanations and apologies.</p>

<p>We went back to the Court, and our case was
dismissed with ignominy and costs. Freemantle,
indeed, had not said a word too much about it. I
<!--Page 215--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
was very sorry for Professor Munro, for he was a
sincere and keen worker for the Liberal party, and
those who advised with him in the early stages of the
petition had grievously misled him; no one supposes
the election was conducted without errors, but things
on the other side were not as black as the Liberals
imagined.</p>

<p>Certainly no word was ever spoken or thought by
the most ardent Radical against Mr. Balfour, the
nominal defendant. His popularity in Manchester
remained and still remains undiminished. No one in
the political world was better loved than Mr. Balfour
by all sorts and conditions of Manchester men.
Even to the very last those who had always voted
against him voted with regret, for they felt they were
parting with the first gentleman in English politics.
As an Ardwick man said in defence of himself and
some of his friends, “Nay, mon, it’s not Arthur
James Balfour we’re tired of&mdash;&#8203;it’s his politics.”</p>

<p>And that reminds me&mdash;&#8203;not directly, I agree, but I
will not waste another page in tracing out the
connection&mdash;&#8203;that reminds me of the story of “The
Good Man and the Manilla Bills.” A certain principal
brought an action against a firm of very
respected merchants. The merchants had acted in
large concerns as his agents. They had shipped
goods for him for many years to foreign parts and
had had complicated financial dealings with him.
He now asserted that for years the merchants had
been defrauding him, and asked for all the accounts
to be opened between them and taken afresh. This
<!--Page 216--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
was, of course, a very serious charge indeed, and when
the case came before the Chancery Court the sole
representative of the firm of merchants was the
Good Man, who I am happy to relate is still with us.</p>

<p>It is not for a common law man like myself to
criticise the ways of a Palatine Chancery Court.
Astbury was my leader, and I was only one of the
team of three who defended the Good Man. Why
I was there I never rightly understood, but I
think I was there to sympathise with the Good Man
in his trouble while Astbury and his eminent
solicitor, the cashier and an eminent and chartered
accountant played hide and seek among the ledgers.
Technically, perhaps, I was taken into the case to
cross-examine, but I don’t remember doing it. These
Chancery fellows love doing it, and as the men on the
other side were Chancery men, and as no one knew
anything about the law of evidence&mdash;&#8203;least of all
the Court&mdash;&#8203;what did it matter? The case lasted
forty odd days. That was to the credit of Chancery
procedure. The leaders arranged each day how
far they should go, and the Court was only too glad
to rise when told that “this” was a convenient
moment, as they were now coming to the Manilla
bills. And that reminds me that it is time I came
to the Manilla bills. They were a nightmare to
Astbury, the eminent solicitor, the cashier and the
eminent and chartered accountant. I do not know
that they affected my sleep, but I gathered they
were the weak point in our case and were probably
going to ruin the Good Man, and that made me very
<!--Page 217--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
sorry. For the worry about the Manilla bills was
that in some mysterious monetary manner, in passing
through banks and ledgers and other financial
filters, it had so panned out that a quarter&mdash;&#8203;or
was it an eighth?&mdash;&#8203;per cent. that belonged undoubtedly
to the plaintiff, remained in the coffers
of the Good Man. It was the most complicated
affair, but there it was. The fact must be found
against us, and then as the Good Man was an agent
dealing with the monies of his principal, would not
the Court take the view that this was fraud, and order
the whole account to be re-opened? The more
we talked over this the more exasperating it became.
The cashier, who had found the system in the
office when he came there, was rather proud of it,
and blankly refused to believe there was anything
wrong about it. The Good Man smilingly gave us
sixteen different explanations of the matter, which
Astbury rejected with a scorn that caused the eminent
solicitor to grow visibly older. Astbury insisted
in his clear logical way on a clear logical defence
of our treatment of the Manilla bills. The difficulty
was there wasn’t one. Even if we could have
invented a theoretical one the Good Man would
have given it away honestly and simply the first
time he was asked. So there we were with the
Manilla bills ahead of us and within a day or
two of the time when we had to put our Good
Man in the box to explain his dealings with them.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Astbury in despair, “I shall have to
lead him through the best explanation we have got.”

<!--Page 218--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
“In the Palatine Court that is always possible,”
I answered; “but isn’t it fatal?”</p>

<p>Astbury groaned.</p>

<p>“Why not let him give all the sixteen explanations?”
I suggested carelessly. “He would love
to do it.”</p>

<p>Astbury and the eminent solicitor looked annoyed
at my flippancy.</p>

<p>However, as it turned out, Providence had a task
for me in that case after all, for the Good Man came
to me and told me that he was so frightened of
Astbury that he would really like me to examine
him.</p>

<p>“I never seem to say what they want me to,”
he said, naïvely.</p>

<p>And in the end, it being clear that no form of
examination of the witness could make the Manilla
bill business any better or worse, the Good Man had
his own way, and he and I collaborated in the
matter. We had a rehearsal. It went like this. I
asked the Good Man, “What about the Manilla bills;
tell me all about them?”</p>

<p>The Good Man started off&mdash;&#8203;I remember I smoked
two cigars of say five and seven-eighths during his
answer. It was then, I think, that he added the
seventeenth explanation, less convincing than the
others. I timed him. He was a rapid speaker,
and then I worked it out in folios&mdash;&#8203;I felt sure the
drama of it was right, and I determined we would
play it out in our own simple way. I fancy the
saner spirits among us washed their hands of the
<!--Page 219--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
enterprise altogether, but even in a Chancery
Court a good comedy well played is irresistible.
And the Good Man was really an excellent witness.
My part was not a speaking one. I merely slipped
him from the leash, so to speak, and away he went.</p>

<p>I remember the indignant tones in which he
swept aside the suggestion of fraud and started out
to victory. The shorthand writers toiled after him,
panting and breathless. It was like a fine course at
Altcar, run with vigour and mettle. At the end
of the first explanation he paused, though only for
a second, and I could see our opponents pitying us&mdash;&#8203;but
he was off again, heading to the opposite bank,
and the reporters after him with dismay in their
faces&mdash;&#8203;and our opponents were laughing at his
contradictions. But not for long. One after
another came the various possible explanations,
always prefaced by a kindly smiling desire to say all
he knew and keep nothing back that could be told.
At one moment the Vice-Chancellor asked him to
repeat one of the theories of the finance of the matter.
He did so. The Vice-Chancellor said he really
could not understand it, so the Good Man repeated
it again, and three pages were added to the shorthand
note. I reckoned before we had finished that the
Good Man had spoken about forty pages of shorthand
notes, and in cross-examination the other side
added another twenty, and an eighteenth new
explanation of the Manilla bills, which may perhaps
have been only a variant of the eleventh. But
the case was won. The Vice-Chancellor had heard
<!--Page 220--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
the Good Man speak the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, and knew that he was honest.
It was a triumph of drama over law, and it was the
Good Man’s own victory.</p>

<p>At the hearing in the Court of Appeal, the
shorthand note was read and commented upon
for several days, and the Manilla bills reduced
the Court to a state of bewildered amazement.
They knew the rights and wrongs of the subject, for
those were elementary, but they could not understand
the Good Man’s evidence. Like the average
manager who reads a play in manuscript, they could
not appreciate the drama of it. And then A. L. Smith&mdash;&#8203;so
like him&mdash;&#8203;said “Let’s have a look at him.”
And he gave a second show of the Manilla bills in
the Court of Appeal. I was a judge then, but when
I heard they had sent for the Good Man to give
evidence I knew all was well. For as soon as he came
into the presence of the Master of the Rolls the case
was over. If there was one man on the bench who
knew an honest man when he saw him it was A. L.</p>

<p>And that reminds me&mdash;&#8203;quite naturally, for A. L.
was a sportsman&mdash;&#8203;and it was a story of the moors he
told me that reminded me of this story which I
once told him&mdash;&#8203;that reminds me of the story of
“The Solicitor and the Ambiguous Grouse.” It is
really Louis Aitken’s story. Would that he were
with us to claim it; but it enables me as a humble
story-teller to take off my hat to him and his story
as I hand it on to others.</p>

<p>We had gone up to a remote County Court among
<!--Page 221--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
the Yorkshire moors to thrash out a small building
dispute. The solicitor who instructed me was an
old friend of Aitken, and they had often shot
together here and elsewhere. During the conduct of
the case it became necessary for me to prove a certain
document the writer of which was not present.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt my friend will admit this,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Aitken, looking very firm.
“I shall want it proved strictly.”</p>

<p>I leaned over to talk to my solicitor about the
impasse, when Aitken continued in a bullying tone,
“There is no difficulty in proving the document.
Your solicitor can prove it, you know,” and then
with great emphasis, “if he dares to go into the
box&mdash;&#8203;if he dares to go into the box!”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Aitken,” said the judge deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“I have my reasons, your Honour&mdash;&#8203;I have my
reasons,” replied Aitken, shaking his head solemnly.</p>

<p>By this time the solicitor was in the box and had
taken the oath and shortly proved the document,
and Aitken arose with a great show of serious
emotion to cross-examine the witness.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the 24th of August, 1889?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I do,” replied the witness with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“This is no joking matter, sir. Attend to me.
I think you and I were shooting on your moor on
that day.”</p>

<p>“We were.”</p>

<p><!--Page 222--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
“What on earth has this got to do with the case,
Mr. Aitken?” asked the learned judge, putting down
his pen.</p>

<p>“Your Honour will see in a moment that it is
most material,” replied Aitken unabashed. “Now,
sir, remember you are on your oath, and answer me
this question without prevarication. Whose bird
was it?”</p>

<p>“Well, really&mdash;&mdash;” began the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Whose bird was it, sir?” shouted Aitken.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe it was yours, Mr. Aitken.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Aitken, triumphantly, and, bowing
to the learned judge, who was shaking with laughter,
he added, with impressive humility, “I trust that,
looking to the satisfactory nature of the witness’s
admission, your Honour will not think I was wasting
the time of the Court in insisting on the strict proof
of the document.”</p>

<p>And I suppose it is Louis Aitken who reminds me
of the Northern Circuit, and I never think of the
circuit without remembering one of the best friends
of all of us, still happily of our number, McCall, K.C.&mdash;&#8203;and
he reminds me of the eminent butcher. There
may be some who have not heard the story of “The
Irishman and the Dishonest Backer.” It is worth
relating, I think, as an example of the strange
attitude of mind existing in the unrighteous about
the administration of the law.</p>

<p>There was a well-known butcher in our neighbourhood,
a great character, and a regular frequenter of
race meetings. He had had a wager with a bookmaker
<!--Page 223--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
named Kelly, and the horse winning had
drawn £200 from the bookmaker. Kelly had
reminded him at the time that the bet was not a
ready-money bet, but the butcher said he wanted the
money, and, the two being friends, had got it. An
objection was afterwards lodged and the winner was
disqualified. Then Kelly wanted his money back.
The butcher declared the bet was “first past the
post,” which it certainly was not, and Kelly brought
his action. The case was brought to me to settle
the defence. Of course, to plead the Gaming Act
was to win the case, and that was done. At the
assizes McCall was briefed to lead me, and the
butcher came to a consultation and tried to persuade
McCall to put him in the witness-box and let him tell
his story about the bet. McCall, with his best and
most rasping north of Ireland accent, told his client
in so many words what he thought of him and his
story, and sent him away to reflect on some serious
home truths. I met the butcher disconsolate in the
corridor waiting for his case to come on. He
stopped me, and, pulling an imaginary forelock in
his simple bucolic way, said in a melancholy voice,
“Mr. Porry, I thowt as ’ow you ’ad this ’ere case o’
mine in ’and.”</p>

<p>“So I have,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, wot do we want wi’ this ’ere Macoll
or Macaul or whatever yer call ’im. Wot’s ’e
for?”</p>

<p>I explained that in important cases the idea was
to have a leader, just as in the butchering business
<!--Page 224--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
you had a foreman. The butcher sniffed uneasily
through my explanation.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Porry,” he said at the end of it,
“would yer mind telling me one thing?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Is this ’ere Macoll or Macaul an Irishman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should say he is,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Aye, I thowt as much,” he said, shaking his head
despairingly. “And you mark my words, Mr. Porry,
it will be a &mdash;&mdash; cross between them two. Thet
Kelly, the plaintiff, ’e’s an Irishman, too.”</p>

<p>I chuckled and did not deny the possibility. It
was amusing to watch my client listen to McCall,
and note his intense relief when he found that the
Gaming Act really worked as he had been told it
would, even in the hands of an Irishman.</p>

<p>And talking of Irishmen reminds me of the story
of “The Arabian and the Merchant,” which from
its remoteness from the every-day affairs of the
circuit is almost as one of Scheherazadé’s own
delightful tales. I can fancy Schariar would have
ordered just such a machine himself as was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus
belli</i> in this case. For the dispute was over a piece
of machinery which a firm of Manchester merchants
had sold to a potentate called the Malektjar of
Bushire. The machine was ordered to be made to
grind corn, bottle soda-water, and make ices, and
when it left this country the evidence was that it
could do all these things. In Persia it was carried
in pieces up country with an engineer, who put it
together and set it in motion. The local holy men of
<!--Page 225--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
Bushire, honestly believing that the machine was
some kind of Nonconformist demon, and a danger to
the national religion, roused up the populace to
pelt it with sand and murder its acolyte, the engineer.
The latter escaped with his life, but the machine
came to a standstill.</p>

<p>The Arabian who had introduced the business
to the merchants now quarrelled with them over
the incidence of the loss. The case was full of detail,
and drifted slowly along to a settlement. During
its progress some eminent Persians visited the Mayor
of Manchester, and we got an order to examine them
on commission about the machine which, it was
alleged, they had seen. This took place before the
Registrar of the High Court. Two gorgeous Easterns
with a suite of attendants and an interpreter duly
arrived, and it took fully an hour to get them sworn.
The potentates desired to kiss the tail of a sacred
cow. The Registrar held that it was not his business
to keep one in the King Street office, and counsel
indulged in a learned argument as to whose duty it
was. Ultimately the witnesses saluted a Reference
Library translation of the Koran, and with doubt
and hesitation and not without prejudice gave
evidence through the interpreter. The evidence
of the first was, “I have never seen the machine.
I have heard it is a false god. They light fires
before it, and it waves its arms.”</p>

<p>Further testimony was successfully objected to
as hearsay. The second was more knowledgeable.
“I have seen the machine. It is no god at all.
<!--Page 226--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
True it is they light fires before it, but it does not
wave its arms, it lies still.” On cross-examination
the witness said he had seen the machine many
times, and “it grew red with years.” A long
examination failed to elicit from the interpreter
whether this was rust, and after much courtesy and
salaams the witnesses left, hugely pleased with
themselves and their adventure. Soon afterwards
briefs were delivered and the assizes came along,
and peace was made between the Arabian and the
merchant with honour, and, if I remember rightly,
each party paid their own costs and lived happily
ever afterwards. And, talking of briefs, that reminds
me of the story of “The Welsh Rector and
the Presbyterian Poacher”&mdash;&#8203;but I forgot. I told
you that one in “Judgment’s in Vacation.”</p>

<p class="p2">Shee said a witty thing to Lord Coleridge, who
was puzzled with the Lancashire dialect. A witness,
in describing a verbal encounter, said, “Then the
defendant turned round and said if ’e didn’t ’owld
’is noise ’e d knock ’im off ’is peark.”</p>

<p>“Peark? Mr. Shee, what is meant by peark?”
asked the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>“Oh, peark, my lord, is any position where a man
elevates himself above his fellows&mdash;&#8203;for instance, a
bench, my lord.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the witness placed an adjective
before the word “peark.” But do not let us bring
the blush of shame to the cheek of modesty. There
is no cheek like the cheek of modesty.</p>

<p>I am reminded of that story by remembering that
it is more than eighteen years since I was elevated
on to my “peark” in Quay Street, Manchester. It
was rather a curious position for me to attain, and
a fortnight before I was appointed I had not the
least idea of applying for the post, and never dreamed
<!--Page 228--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
that I should get it if I did. I had been very
fortunate in my practice, and had, if anything, too
much to do; and I confess that working at high
pressure by night as well as by day not only had no
charms for me, but injured my health. The
amount of travelling one did was a great strain
on the nerves. I recollect in four consecutive days
doing cases at Fleetwood, at Hull, at London, and
then at Manchester. One wanted to be as strong
as the proverbial horse to get through the work
without a breakdown. About ten days before
Whitsuntide, I was in a case in town in the Court
of Appeal, and I happened to meet a well-known
Lancashire member, who began discussing with me
the resignation of Judge Heywood and the chances
of the various candidates for his place. None of
them seemed entirely to his liking, and he suddenly
suggested that I should ask for it. So little did I
know of the matter that I thought it was a condition
precedent to the office that a barrister should be
of ten years’ standing, and to make sure about this we
went across to my friend’s chambers in the Temple
and looked the matter up. It turned out to be
seven years and thus made me eligible.</p>

<p>Travelling home, the idea of regular hours of
work and equally regular hours of leisure seemed to
possess my mind, and I could think of nothing else.
One would have to make sacrifices, no doubt, but
the credit side of the imaginary balance-sheet
seemed far heavier than the debit. So it was that,
after some domestic debate, I wrote to the Right
<!--Page 229--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
Honourable James Bryce, who was then Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, and told him that if he
wished to appoint me as judge of the County Court,
I was at his disposal. The only person I mentioned
it to was my old friend Byrne, because I knew he
was making application himself. The Whitsuntide
holidays came along, and we went to Seascale, in
Cumberland, and I heard nothing about the appointment
for more than a week. One Monday morning
we were having breakfast at our hotel when my friend
Charles Hughes, who was staying in the village,
came in flourishing a morning paper, and saying, with
mock reverence, “Good morning, your Honour.”
When we opened our letters there was a kind note
from Mr. Bryce, appointing me to the judgeship.
It had reached Manchester on Saturday, but Seascale
in those days had no Sunday post. That was,
I believe, very nearly Mr. Bryce’s last official act
as Chancellor of the Duchy. As Louis Aitken&mdash;&#8203;that
genial companion who disguised his wit and
learning in an obtrusive Lancashire accent and a
downright utterance of homely truths&mdash;&#8203;declared
the first time he met me in Manchester: “Another
appointment of that kind would have ruined any
Government.” So they took Mr. Bryce away
from the Duchy and made him President of the
Board of Trade.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I altogether enjoyed the change
during the first twelve months of my judgeship. In
the first place, I had a serious and not unexpected
breakdown in health, and, secondly, I had the great
<!--Page 230--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">222</span>
misfortune to lose Mr. Registrar Lister, whose long
experience of the Court and its working was invaluable.
I found, too, that judicial work is a very
lonely business. From the moment of entering the
side door in Byrom Street to the time one got out
again one became an unpleasant official person.
People “addressed” you instead of talking to you,
and with unblushing sycophancy pretended that
they believed you to possess a cyclopædic knowledge
of the law. How many times have I been told that
legal cases were “within your Honour’s recollection,”
or “your Honour will no doubt be thinking of the
case of ‘Jones <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="versus">.v</abbr></i> Smith’,” when counsel were well
aware that it was long odds against the Court having
in mind any case whatever.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many advantages about a
“peark” like a County Court, but the main difference
between it and my former work at the Bar was
that one was an unfriendly, solitary job, whilst the
whole spirit of the other was genial and sociable.
However, I made one rule that was a great joy to
me. It became a penal offence to send any paper,
book, or document of, or connected with, the Court
to my house. At last I was able to keep my work
outside my home, and when I did get out of my cage
and turn my head up Peter Street, I at least knew I
was a free man until to-morrow morning. But
if judicial work tends to make one morose, the
good-fellowship that abounds in Manchester more
than corrected the tendency. I have heard judges
say that it is a mistake to live in the district in which
<!--Page 231--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
they work, but I confess I do not agree. During my
seventeen years in Manchester I went about in clubs
and to social gatherings of every kind, and I never
remember being spoken to about a case or heard a
case discussed in my presence. The sense and
courtesy of all classes in Manchester made life very
pleasant when working hours were over.</p>

<p>One thoughtless request I do remember, which
had an amusing sequel. A friend of mine coming
down in the train&mdash;&#8203;we will call him Robinson&mdash;&#8203;shouted
across the carriage that he was summoned
for to-morrow as a juryman, and as it was his mail
day he wanted to be let off. I at once reprimanded
him, and told him he would certainly be fined five
pounds if he stayed away. The next day I called
for the jury list and found “Robinson” at the
bottom of the column. Taking a pencil I transferred
him to the top, and when the list was called “John
Robinson” came first, and I made him a most formal
bow as the policeman led him into the box. As luck
would have it, the case he was on lasted until
7 o’clock at night, so his mail day had to go on without
him. The next morning in the train I explained
to him the disadvantages of asking favours of high-souled
and upright judges, and he agreed that it was
not a wise thing to do. But he consoled himself, he
said, in two ways: “I had a very entertaining day,
and, being away from the office, I saved several
hundred pounds by not buying on what turned out
to be a falling market.”</p>

<p>After the first few years we never had any jury
<!--Page 232--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
cases, and for myself I think juries in the County
Court are generally a mistake. There is too little
time, and too many cases to try in the time, to deal
with a jury case at proper length. I do not think I
can fairly claim to be a great judge, but I do flatter
myself that I am an uncommon common jury. And
from a County Court point of view that is an asset.
It requires some dramatic instinct to take by
intuition the same view of facts that eight tradesmen
would take if they had heard the same evidence.
To approach a subject full of a prejudice you have
not got, but which, as a jury, you ought to have, and
gradually by listening to your own judicial remonstrances
to lay down the cherished prejudice you
never really had, and still to let a little of it appear
in the final sum you award&mdash;&#8203;that, I take it, is an
attitude of mind not to be achieved without serious
study. I think it may have been because I had more
sympathy with the facts of life than with the legal
aspect of affairs that Louis Aitken used to say in my
praise, “that a common judge was quite as good a
tribunal as a common jury.”</p>

<p>The work of the Manchester County Court was
divided into days for the poor people’s cases and
days for the heavier work, which were printed in
black and red on the calendars. This convenient
system is at last finding its way into other places.
I took a great deal of interest in the black-letter days,
as they were called, for the smaller work, though
trifling in amount, was often not trifling in the
proportion of the amount to the weekly wage of the
<!--Page 233--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
litigants. If I have learned any lesson in the many
days I have spent listening to the short and simple
annals of the back street, it is that the law of
imprisonment for debt bears very harshly on the
working class. In season and out of season I have
preached the injustice and inequality of the law in
this matter, and we have had commissions and
inquiries sufficient to reorganise the whole legal
system of the State, but out of this groaning mountain
not so much as a statutory mouse has yet
proceeded. I should like to be still on my “peark”
when the list of the day is called over without a
single judgment summons in it.</p>

<p>And I am not one of those who, because he is a
magisterial or judicial person, thinks his mouth is
closed as a citizen from reporting the evil things by
which he is surrounded. It is true one can report
them as one does to one’s pastors and masters in
Royal Commissions and elsewhere, but these high
ones of the earth are too engrossed in greater affairs
to attend to such a small matter as the sending to
gaol of some eight or more thousand of the thriftless
and shiftless of their fellow-countrymen. And one
has the great army of the lower middle-class shopkeepers,
who think it is to their advantage to give
credit where there is no credit, and they are right up
against reform; and behind them stand the wholesale
traders who sell to the little shopkeepers, but have
the sense themselves to see that they get their money
regularly on the second Tuesday of the next month.
And I suppose those of us who are interested in this
<!--Page 234--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
matter will go on uttering ineffectively our protests
in evidence before commissions and in reviews and
magazines and occasional addresses to students
of social science until at last a public opinion is
formed strong enough to be heard in the lobbies
at Westminster.</p>

<p>I have often wondered how many tons of waste-paper
filter through the waste-paper basket and solidify
into one grain of public opinion. But it is better
so than that some tragedy should happen, some death
in gaol or some horrid act of violence which would
startle the comfortable classes into a recognition of the
injustice of the system. However good and necessary
a reform may be, it is probably not much use having
it before the large majority of citizens are really ready
for it. The working classes could abolish imprisonment
for debt at once, but some of their number think
it enables credit to be obtained in times of labour disputes,
and are listless about it; the middle classes
think that any form of compulsion to make the working
classes pay for the goods they sell to them is a just
and righteous thing; whilst as for the upper classes,
the few I have come in contact with seem to think
that imprisonment for debt, don’t you know, was
abolished, and that when a fellow was really “stony”&mdash;&#8203;I
think I have the phrase right&mdash;&#8203;he went bankrupt,
don’t you know, and started afresh. And that,
indeed, is a true statement of the different way in
which the English law treats the affairs of debtors,
according to whether they be rich or poor&mdash;&#8203;for the
poor man has no effective bankruptcy law.</p>

<p><!--Page 235--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
And another thing that seems to me to bear very
hardly on the workers, and makes it increasingly
difficult for them to keep out of debt, is the heavy
proportion of their income that goes in rent. If a
man with £1,000 a year spent two hundred or two
hundred and fifty in rent he would be regarded as
extravagant. But that is what a working man has
to do out of his slender income before he can find
food and clothing for his wife and family. And the
curious affair is that wherever you go, whether it be
Manchester, Salford, Lambeth or Dartford, the
problem seems to remain the same. Where, as in
London, wages are rather better, rent is very much
higher, as though in some weird economic way the
fact that a man earns more money in London than
he does in Manchester at the same trade entitles
his landlord to a higher rent for even worse accommodation.
And how this is going to be remedied is
for those professors of social economics who have
studied the question to say, but one who has
discussed with many thousands of poor folk their
ways and means, and the burdens of their life, may
at least point out what seems to be the fact, that in
increasing the wage of a man, you do not make him
necessarily a citizen with a better chance in life
unless you can manage to stop the automatic
increase of his rent. For the landlord, like the
daughter of the horse-leech, on hearing of a rise in
wages, cries, “Give! Give!” and there is nothing
for it but to obey.</p>

<p>And another thing which is constantly before my
<!--Page 236--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
mind in the work of the County Court is that, like
all institutions that were intended in the first instance
for the service of the poor, the County Courts have
gradually interested themselves in the affairs of
better-class people, and to some extent their earlier
clients are being edged out. Of course, that is the
history of many English institutions, and one must
suppose that to some extent it is a natural evolution,
and accept it as such. Pious Bishop Ridley was a
suitor to Sir William Cecil “in our Master Christ’s
cause” to grant him the Palace of Bridewell, “that
he might therein house the naked and hungry that
starved in the London streets.” This noble charity
by natural evolution degenerated into one of the
most degraded and brutal of prisons, as Hogarth has
reminded us forever in one of his prints in “The
Harlot’s Progress.” In the same way, if you read
the early histories of many colleges and schools and
charities, you will find that the pious founders had
in their minds the advancement and interests of the
poorer classes, but to-day the benefits of these
institutions are almost entirely in the hands of the
middle and upper classes. I daresay they make
better use of them, and that it is all to the good that
it should be so, but one cannot shut one’s eyes to the
fact that something of this sort has been the general
history of our attempts to equip the poor with
social institutions for their benefit.</p>

<p>And although I am not against the making of the
County Court a valuable district court for the
settlement of disputes of importance, I cannot help
<!--Page 237--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
thinking that something might be done to make the
courts of greater value to the poor. As at present,
apart from the debt-collecting about which I have
said my say, the Court is mainly used by the poor
to settle very small and domestic quarrels. But
so swollen have the rules and orders and forms of
the Court grown, so intricate are its ways, that for
an uneducated man to find his correct path among its
mazes without a legal guide would be impossible.
No doubt the Registrar and his clerks give every
assistance in their power. Certainly the poor man
who wants to maintain trover for a wheelbarrow
cannot be expected to spend twenty-five shillings on
a “County Court Practice” and read its thousand
pages in search of the answer to the riddle of procedure
that the law has set him. Yet unless he
employs a solicitor or casts his cares on the overburdened
chief clerk to the Registrar, I suppose
that is what the State expects him to do.</p>

<p>The County Court as a tribunal for doing justice
between poor disputants is an ill-equipped machine,
and, without doubt, if these poorer cases were
tried by the judge on strict legal lines, and if he
merely listened to the plaintiff and heard such
portions of his and his friends’ wandering narratives
as came within the rules of evidence, the almost
universal result would be to non-suit the plaintiff
on the ground that he proved no case. But in
practice this does not happen. The wind is
tempered to the shorn lamb. The judge puts his
legal telescope to his blind eye. He listens to
<!--Page 238--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
everything and everybody and both sides speaking
at once. He takes a hand at the game himself with
such worldly knowledge of the man in the street
as he happens to possess, and in the end gropes his
way through a mass of prejudice and hearsay and
hatred, malice and all uncharitableness, and conveniently
forgets that no one has complied with this
section of a statute or that rule or that order, and
business of a kind is done.</p>

<p>But it would be far more satisfactory if the affairs
of smaller people were not litigated, or at all
events not litigated until an effort had been made to
bring the parties together and get them to agree to
a compromise. For think of the cost of much of
this small litigation and what it may mean to a
working man, and how much ill-feeling as well as
hard-earned money would be saved if the parties
could be brought together in some Courts of Conciliation
or Reconcilement, and were not permitted
to go to law until, as a condition precedent, they had
been before the County Court judge and satisfied
him that there was no chance of a settlement, and
he marked their papers “fit” for litigation.</p>

<p>And though many will think this a revolutionary
movement, yet in truth it is nothing of the sort. For
the idea is as old as the hills&mdash;&#8203;and Paul thought it a
disgrace, even to the Corinthians&mdash;&#8203;who were no
great class, as I gather&mdash;&#8203;for brother to go to law with
brother. What he would have written to Lancashire
about the spectacle of three or four brothers and
sisters wrangling in the County Court as to who
<!--Page 239--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
should pay for their father’s funeral tea&mdash;&#8203;the
sensible old man having died penniless&mdash;&#8203;I scarce
like to think. Luckily Paul wrote no Epistles to
the Lancastrians. For when passions are roused,
family feuds are fought with a bitterness that few
can understand whose duty has not forced them to
witness the wretchedness of it. And the day of
awakening comes with the taxation of costs and a
sense that all that has been done has been to give
way to an orgy of unholiness in a public place and
make a great hole in savings laboriously acquired.</p>

<p>But apart from the uncharitable nature of many
law-suits let me set down the actual facts of one of
the every-day cases which bring debt and ruin
upon a home. A man had a dog which bit the child
of a neighbour. The child was not greatly injured,
but there was a small doctor’s bill to pay and a
certain amount of anxiety on behalf of the parents.
These people chose solicitors. After a lengthy correspondence
a claim was brought for £25 by the parents
of the child. Counsel were engaged. Doctors gave
evidence on either side. Ultimately the case went
against the plaintiff, on the ground that he could not
prove <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scienter</i>, that is to say, that he did not satisfy
the Court that the defendant knew that his dog had
previously bitten someone else.</p>

<p>Now one need not blame the lawyers. If each
party believed in his own case and wanted to fight, the
lawyers only did their duty according to the system
under which they work. The result was disastrous.
Each party was ordered to pay his own costs,
<!--Page 240--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
which worked out at something over £15 apiece.
In any case, as I remember it, the plaintiff could
only have recovered a few pounds, for the damage
was but small.</p>

<p>Now Paul’s idea, and a valuable one, was summed
up in the question “Is it so that there cannot be
found among you one wise man who shall be able
to decide between his brethren?” Only I think
he overlooked the natural distrust that the average
man has of a lay arbitrator. I do not think it
would be reasonable to expect two members of a
Welsh chapel, for instance, to leave their dispute
to a deacon. The deacon knows too much of their
inner life to start with, and would be bound to be
suspected of partiality in his judgment. Paul’s
idea of a Lay Court of Conciliation or Reconcilement
was not practical politics in a work-a-day
world. But when Brougham took up the idea and
tried to get the House of Lords to help him put it
into a business shape, one wonders that he got no
assistance for so excellent a scheme. His plan was
to make use of existing judges as conciliators, and the
result of the combined teachings of the Saint and the
Lord Chancellor seems to be that what you want is a
sensible conciliator who shall also be a State official.</p>

<p>For in the dog-bite affair recorded above&mdash;&#8203;supposing
that there had been a Conciliation Court
to which the plaintiff could have summoned the
defendant, and both parties had appeared before
the judge to talk it over&mdash;&#8203;a little discussion might,
one would think, have brought the parties to understand
<!--Page 241--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
that the payment of the doctor’s bill or some
such course was a fair thing to do, and that pressing
vague claims of damage could result in no useful
purpose. And if the parties had agreed, they could
have signed an agreement in the presence of the
Conciliator, which, if not carried out, could afterwards
be made an order of Court. But if the judge
could not bring them to agree they could still go to
law, and no great harm would have been done by
their meeting.</p>

<p>And in claims under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act there is good reason why some such course
should be made compulsory. For when the Act was
introduced, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain expected it to
be an automatic scheme, and took credit for the
government that “we have held it to be a first
principle as well as one of our first objects to avoid
litigation.” There were to be no lawyers employed
and no appeals were to be allowed. What has
happened in fact everyone knows. The Bill was so
altered in Parliament and by succeeding legislation
as to flood the County Courts with litigation of an
expensive and difficult nature, and to clog the
Court of Appeal with endless discussions on what
are from the insurance point of view&mdash;&#8203;and that
is the business point of view&mdash;&#8203;trifling matters. And
every day one is face to face with the pitiable
spectacle of a working man, not necessarily a
malingerer&mdash;&#8203;but a neurasthenic subject&mdash;&#8203;physically
fit to work, or at least to get into condition to work,
and yet not capable of exercising the necessary will
<!--Page 242--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
power to do so, and gradually becoming more and
more unfit. And the cause of the bulk of this is
litigation. When a man is getting better and his
mind should be turned towards work he has at his
elbow a lawyer and a doctor, who, being human,
have their scientific opinions biassed perhaps by the
thought that only by carrying the case into Court
can they hope to get any fees. The man is told
it would be unwise to work both legally and physically.
What is he to do? Is he to throw over his
scientific advisers&mdash;&#8203;why should he? Would you or
I settle a case or abandon a claim against the advice
of our lawyers? Nor do I blame the lawyer. He
is there to advise, and often without his advice the
man could not recover his rights, and certainly
could not maintain his rights in the Court of Appeal
and on to the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The lawyers are a necessary part of the scheme as
it exists, and so are the doctors. They hinder the
man from getting well and going back to work, but
that is all part of the machine. The machine is not
a bad one, and no one wants to see it scrapped.
We want to return to the Chamberlain ideal and
wheel our machine out of the Law Courts into the
yard, and work it under the power of common
sense. Only in that way can we escape some dishonourable
responsibility for that half-malingerer,
that weak, insincere invalid, the miserable remains
of what was once a good workman, which is such
a common object of the County Court.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in saying that by a system
<!--Page 243--><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
of conciliation 75 per cent. of the present litigation
under the Workmen’s Compensation Act might be
stopped, to the great benefit of the community. I
would allow no Workmen’s Compensation Act case
to go forward to litigation until employer and workman
had come in person&mdash;&#8203;or by lay deputy on the
employer’s behalf&mdash;&#8203;to discuss a way out. Many a
workman would go back and try work again if he
could go into a room and talk his affair over with
a judge, and was assured that his interests would be
cared for whilst he made the experiment.</p>

<p>The scheme of workmen’s compensation was
intended by Mr. Chamberlain to be a businesslike
and statesmanlike scheme of accident insurance
to be administered by a County Court judge,
acting as an arbitrator, with the assistance of a
medical referee. There were, as I have said, to be
no lawyers and no appeals, which to his business mind
were merely things leading to “expense, annoyance,
and irritation.” The statesman desired and intended
a scheme for the benefit of employer and
workman based on peace and conciliation, but the
lawyers have been too many for him, and to-day
the Workmen’s Compensation Act litigation is little
better than a wild-cat legal gamble. To diagnose
whether an accident arises out of or in the course
of a workman’s employment you want a legal mind
combining the subtlety of a Jesuit with the
discrimination of a laboratory professor. And even
then you may fail if your mind is anything but an
exact replica of two out of the three of those who
<!--Page 244--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
will ultimately sit to hear the appeal. Nor is there
indeed always safety in that, for there is the House
of Lords to come&mdash;&#8203;and if you think the word
“gamble” is too strong a word for the existing
state of things, ring them up at Lloyds and ask for
the current rate of odds against any Workmen’s
Compensation Act appeal on its voyage from the
Strand to Westminster.</p>

<p>But it will be said, is not all this rather an attack
on the writer’s own profession? I do not think so.
I have tried to make it clear that I blame the
system, and not the individuals who have to work it.
And though I believe that any sort of Court of
Reconcilement or Conciliation must in time do away
with much litigation, I do not necessarily think that
a bad thing for the profession. How often to-day
do lawyers try and keep their clients from litigation
and promote compromise to their own cost, to
satisfy their high ideals of right action. I am far
from thinking it desirable that we should keep alive
a system of litigation that we believe harmful to the
community because it brings in fees to ourselves. The
spectacle in “Jarndyce v. Jarndyce,” where “eighteen
of Mr. Tangle’s learned friends, each armed with a
little summary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up
like eighteen hammers in a pianoforte, make eighteen
bows, and drop into their eighteen places of obscurity,”
may have pleased the unthinking lawyer of the day,
but Dickens, with prophetic foresight, knew more
about it than the Bar. It had to be swept away.
And has it ruined the Chancery Bar?&mdash;&#8203;ask them in
<!--Page 245--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
Lincoln’s Inn. The fact is that if we are to maintain
in the face of better-educated and more thoughtful
citizens the privileges and traditions of the Bar, we
must satisfy ourselves and the world that the work
we are doing is worthy, useful work beneficial to the
community. When it fails to come up to that
standard, it ought to be joyfully surrendered.</p>

<p>Nor do I think that my suggestions would, even
if they were carried out by a stroke of the pen,
injure any practitioner to any serious extent. New
problems are arising daily and new work is waiting
to be done. But whether the results of conciliation
would be to the injury of the profession or not,
before anything is done the lawyers will have their
say on it in the Houses of Parliament, where their
number is legion, and where, as far as I can make
out, the poor litigant, the client whose interests I
am saying a word for to-day, is wholly unknown
and unrepresented.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">OVERTIME</h4>

<p class="small">To play is for a man to do what he pleases or to do nothing&mdash;&#8203;to
go about soothing his particular fancies</p>

<p class="p1 flushright small"><span class="sc">Charles Lamb</span>: “Letter to Bernard Barton.”</p>

<p class="p2">That idea of soothing your particular fancy gives
to me the very clearest image of play and playtime.
And most men’s fancies take a deal of soothing,
since man will fancy himself and his capabilities to
be x, when his nearest and dearest could tell him, if
they were not his nearest and dearest, that they are
not even y, but something far nearer to <span class="decoration">a b c</span>.</p>

<p>And as long as a man does not fancy himself at
his real work, but only in playtime, what does it
matter? For in a sane man it seems a natural
attribute that he should dislike work he is peculiarly
fitted for, and should hanker after jobs that he is
naturally ill-equipped to perform. I always looked
forward to what I called “overtime,” when I could
get away from briefs and law books, and put in a
few solid hours spoiling beautiful hand-made paper
with inharmonious water-colours, or writing plays
and stories that nobody wanted to publish. Why
I should have called it “overtime” I do not know,
for real overtime is paid at least at the rate of “time
<!--Page 247--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
and a quarter,” but my overtime generally cost me
money. Perhaps the idea I have in calling it
“overtime” is that these tasks could only be done
after the day’s work was over, which is the only
attribute my “overtime” had in common with the
overtime of the working man.</p>

<p>From my earliest days&mdash;&#8203;when to the dread and
horror of my family I bought a fiddle and tried to
learn to play it&mdash;&#8203;I have experienced a sane and
healthy desire to spend my working hours on jobs
I know I can never do, rather than in exercising
capacities which have always been with me. I call
it a sane and healthy tendency, because I find it to
exist in nearly everyone who feels physically and
mentally well.</p>

<p>I once knew a plus 2 golfer who spent all his overtime
away from the links in trying to grow tomatoes
out of doors. Each season the climate&mdash;&#8203;which he
spoke of as a horticultural bogey&mdash;&#8203;was at least 7 up
on him before the first frost came and stopped the
round. But he had many merry hours in his garden,
and laughed gaily when he topped a budding plant
with a careless approach with a hoe or was badly
bunkered by a patent manure. What really bored
him was the monotony of golf with eighteen perfect
drives every round he played. It was only on those
rare occasions when he pulled or sliced into the
rough that I have known him to smile and openly
admit “that there was some fun in the old game,
after all.”</p>

<p>I early discovered the delights of “overtime” in
<!--Page 248--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
my father’s library, where I was supposed to do my
home-work whilst I was at King’s College School.
There I read all the great English writers with a
larger enjoyment, because, like the Jew who ate the
pork chop, I could feel that I was “sinning at the
same time.” I think that library and its contents
are entirely responsible for my taste in overtime.
Shakespeare, Fielding, Smollett, Dickens, Thackeray,
Mrs. Opie, and Aphra Behn. I remember the very
format of each volume. I do not think there was a
single dramatist or novelist of any mark in the
English tongue that was unrepresented.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite book was Cumberland’s
“British Theatre,” with its forty-eight volumes.
The stage-directions of the bloodiest of the melodramas
were my favourite reading. Their only
rival was the brief in some sporting case which lay
on the table at which I worked. I would often slip
the papers out of their red tape and peruse them far
more diligently than I did in after days, when I was
paid for doing so. How carefully I read the solicitor’s
story of the case. In later years I found that no
self-respecting advocate ever studied these lengthy
pages, well understanding that under an absurd
legal system they are put there merely for the
taxing master to appraise and allow in the form
of costs.</p>

<p>I remember Nash being amusingly scored off by a
well-known solicitor, who rather plumed himself on
his frugal literary gifts, and took much pains in the
composition of the story of a case. He complained
<!--Page 249--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
to Nash that he never read these narratives, and
Nash had assured him, out of polite respect to his
hobby, that he always made a point of studying
them and greatly admired them. Soon afterwards
Nash was instructed by the solicitor to defend a
client in a criminal case at the assizes, and a fat
brief, marked “30 guas” and beginning with a very
lengthy narrative, was delivered to counsel. How
far Nash read any of it I do not know, but he duly
acquitted the prisoner. To Nash’s annoyance and
surprise&mdash;&#8203;for the solicitor was a most solvent and
respectable person&mdash;&#8203;the fees were not paid. Nash’s
clerk made several efforts to solve the mystery,
and was told that they had been paid to Mr. Nash
at the assizes, but Nash knew that this was not
so, and was very indignant with the solicitor
about it. A month or two afterwards Nash met
the solicitor in Cross Street, and going up to him
expressed his views of the solicitor’s conduct very
roundly.</p>

<p>“But I paid you at the assizes, Mr. Nash.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort, sir, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Did you read my story of the case, Mr. Nash?”
asked the solicitor.</p>

<p>“Of course, I did. I always read every word of
my briefs,” said the unblushing Nash.</p>

<p>“H’m, that’s very curious. I can’t understand
it,” said the solicitor, with his head on one side, and
his left eye half-closed. “I can’t understand it at
all, because on page three of that statement of the
case I pinned a cheque for your fees, and&mdash;&#8203;hadn’t
<!--Page 250--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
you better go back to chambers, Mr. Nash, and read
that brief again?”</p>

<p>But when I was a lad the introduction to the brief
was my first study. If it looked dull and boresome
I dropped the papers speedily. How often in after
life I wished I could deal with briefs in similar fashion.
And as no child will ever read these pages I may
confess that from the short years of my schooling the
only things that remain with me are elegant extracts
of forbidden reading; forbidden not by my father, I
should say in fairness to both of us, for he knew all
about it and winked, but by my pastors and masters.</p>

<p>I think it is Walt Whitman who expresses the
thought that he would like to get away from
mankind and “turn and live among the animals,
they are so placid and self-contained.” And I have
the same kind of feeling about school-masters. The
prosperous incompetence of the school-master is
to me one of the great mysteries of life. When I
lived among school-masters a cowardly idolatry,
the offspring of tyranny and coercion, prevented
me using opportunities to make careful observation
of their mental and moral constitution. I had a
vague knowledge that they were hopelessly wrong,
but I had not the energy and ability to analyse the
wherefore of it. Physically they were of varying
size and beauty, but mentally they were absolutely
and uniformly all alike. It never occurred to my
young mind that this was a natural result of pouring
youthful educational hot stuff into an old-fashioned
mould and turning it out when it had grown cold.</p>

<p><!--Page 251--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
There were, of course, many charming persons
among them. What an excellent fellow was E&mdash;&mdash;.
I have long forgiven him, but his offence was rank
and smells to heaven. He it was who persuaded me
for a whole term to spend my overtime on school
books. I have some prizes on my shelves now, the
result of my foolish complaisance. I have never
looked inside them, but the bindings are handsome,
and they serve as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</i> of wasted hours
that can never be replaced. The speculation was
commercially sound, no doubt, but whilst I was
doing it my conscience smote me. The next term
I dropped it, and my good friend, with that rare
prophetic insight that enables the school-master
to foresee the unbetiding, filed my deficiency
account in words that still have a haunting sound
of failure: “has some ability, but no staying power.”</p>

<p>It does not need an alphabet of scholastic degrees
to enable a man to back a double event and find both
of them to be losers. And yet old E&mdash;&mdash;’s epigram,
that looked at the time so like real stable information,
was but a huckster’s tip after all. Most of my relatives
and all my real friends, those who know best,
have cheerily shaken their heads at the word ability&mdash;&#8203;did
so, I remember, at the time&mdash;&#8203;and have admitted
that he was wrong there, but even E&mdash;&mdash; himself
would not now, I think, gainsay the fact that I have
stayed the course. And yet my innate reverence for
the school-master is such that I have an uneasy
feeling that I ought to have so shaped my life that
the words of the school-master might be fulfilled, and
<!--Page 252--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
that in not having done so I am in danger of
judgment.</p>

<p>The early days of the Bar are all overtime. And
the first big overtime job that I undertook, and
perhaps the pleasantest I ever carried through, was
the preparation of a version of “Dorothy Osborne’s
Letters,” the first edition of which I finished in
my early days at Manchester, and published in 1888.
I remember my joy when Mr. Comyns Carr, who then
edited the <cite>English Illustrated Magazine</cite>, accepted
my first essay on Dorothy Osborne. How I still
reverence his critical acumen. The joys of winning
a legal scholarship, or having that first brief at quarter
sessions delivered to you by a real solicitor’s clerk,
have none of that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tremens</i> delirium about them that
you attain when your literary essay is accepted in
a courteous autograph from a master in letters.
The manuscript of “Dorothy Osborne’s Letters,”
like all great works, was refused by many of the
leading publishers, and when it was published the
book was an immediate success. It has been pirated
in many countries, and will, I think, remain in the
English library, not on account of any work of mine,
but because of the peculiar charm of Mistress
Dorothy’s style in letter-writing. It was a satisfactory
bit of “overtime.”</p>

<p>My next book was a life of Macklin, the actor,
written for a series edited by William Archer. Mr.
Lowe wrote a life of Betterton. Mr. Archer himself
wrote Macready, and then came my “Life of
Macklin.” For some reason or other that ended the
<!--Page 253--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
series. It was not half a bad book, and a friend of
mine in Dublin says my chapter on the Irish stage
has amused and entertained him for many pleasant
hours in tracing out and confuting by authority the
errors and inaccuracies it contains&mdash;&#8203;but, then, he
admits that no other Saxon had ever dared to try
and write such a chapter.</p>

<p>And I suppose it is only right to enter on these
time-sheets my journalistic work as overtime. I
know nothing so exhilarating as journalism. If I
was really to take to writing as a business, I should
hire an upper chamber in some building which was
gently rocked from below by a steady throbbing
engine, and arrange for the smell of its oil, coupled
with the aroma of printer’s ink, to pervade the
atmosphere, then having hired a whistling and
insistent boy, with a raucous voice, to put his head
in and shout “copy” at me every quarter of an
hour, I should sit down to work, hopefully assured
of a glorious “spate of style.” For many years I
wrote dramatic criticism and reviewed books, and
wrote “shorts” and occasionally full-dress leaders
for the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>. I do not think I had
any very particular reputation in Cross Street,
except for punctuality and dispatch. It is not every
journalist who has even these humble attributes,
but they were evidently well remembered of me.</p>

<p>I mind meeting C. P. Scott one autumn morning
some three years after I had been judge, as I was
walking down to my work&mdash;&#8203;along the fragrant groves
of Rusholme. He seemed somewhat disconsolate
<!--Page 254--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
and told me his trouble. He had an advance copy
of “Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s Letters,” and
through illness there was no one in the office free
to review it. Two columns about were wanted
before going to press. “I wish, Parry,” he said,
with half a sigh, “that you were available.”</p>

<p>Of course I was available. The book, with its two
volumes of over eight hundred pages, came down to
the Court. I started it in the luncheon hour. I got
at it again after the Court rose at about 4 o’clock,
and before 11 at night I entered the office and
was received with enthusiasm by a grateful sub-editor
thirsting for copy. I compared my work the
next day with that of some of the London champions,
the plus 4 men at the game. I had scooped
out nearly all the tit-bits, and I had done more.
I had discovered that Mrs. Browning’s baby was a
good half-column, and the other fellows had missed
that delightful child altogether. Moreover, I had
not only written my review, but I had copied out all
my extracts, for I never could bear the thought of
mutilating a book, and so the volumes remain with
me as a pleasant memory of a happy day’s overtime.
For when I had had some supper I had missed the
last tram, and dreaming that I was still in the days of
my youth and could not afford a hansom, I had a
joyful walk home in the moonlight.</p>

<p>And long before that, whilst I was at the Bar,
Hulton, the elder, came into my chambers and asked
me to write some articles for the <cite>Sunday Chronicle</cite>.
For some reason or other a new hand was suddenly
<!--Page 255--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
wanted. The articles had to be a column and a
turn-over. Any subject might be written upon as
long as the writing was tense, vivid and entertaining
and the matter was of popular interest. The
manuscript had to be ready by Friday. I doubted
my capacity for the task, but Hulton told me that
he had been assured by that kind-hearted doyen of
the craft, Spencer of the <cite>Guardian</cite>, that I was all
right. I bowed to his verdict, for to me Spencer’s
was the last word about journalistic matters.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that week. Nothing happened.
Day succeeded day in stagnant succession, no one of
importance said or did anything. There was not a
crime or a law-suit, or even a political speech in
which one could pretend an interest. On the
Thursday morning I rose early and rushed at the
newspapers. The same dismal outlook of barren
nothingness. I passed the canal and looked at its
waters lovingly. Was I to disgrace myself by going
back on the verdict of Spencer? It seemed impossible
that I could do that and live.</p>

<p>About midday, whilst sitting in chambers with a
blank sheet of paper before me, symbolic of the
mind within, my clerk brought in some papers, and
in a diffident off-hand manner said casually, “I
suppose you’ve heard the news!”</p>

<p>“News,” I cried testily, “there is none.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel.</p>

<p>“What is it, then?” I called after him.</p>

<p>“Only Mr. Parnell’s dead!”</p>

<p>I had a real reverence for Parnell, but to undertakers
<!--Page 256--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
and journalists death is indeed the reaper, and
the poor gleaners cannot be blamed that they are
thankful when the season brings them their only
harvest. In truth I never wrote with greater sense
of responsibility nor with a more eager desire that
every word and sound should toll the message of his
life into the hearts of my readers. Heaven knows
how far I succeeded. It was enough for me that
Spencer nodded approval. And to the quiet homage
for the statesman that most of us have to-day there
comes into my heart a thrill of grateful emotion
whenever I hear the name of Parnell.</p>

<p>I wrote those <cite>Sunday Chronicle</cite> articles for some
time, but it was a worrying task, and my work at the
Bar began to creep into the overtime, and ultimately,
like Aaron’s rod, swallowed up all other pursuits.
But I look back to the task with pleasure, because it
enabled me to write an article to the glory of Charles
Hopwood and his policy, and I still possess a faded
letter, full of hope for the future and thanks for the
help that had been given to the cause he had so much
at heart. Of course, I had known Hopwood as a
leader on circuit for some years, but after the
<cite>Chronicle</cite> article he began to talk to me about his
various views and plans of reform in a way that was
deeply interesting.</p>

<p>And to go back to my earliest recollection of
Hopwood I must go back to when I first joined
the circuit, and recount an early journey to Lancaster
Assizes with Falkner Blair. He had been
retained to defend a wretched man who, in a fit of
<!--Page 257--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
despair, had taken the lives of his three children.
It was a very sad case, and the only line of defence
was insanity. When the train stopped at Wigan a
gentleman got into our carriage for a smoke. He
got into conversation with Blair, and hearing of the
murder case expressed his desire to attend the trial.
He turned out to be the Reverend E. Burnaby, a
brother of the celebrated Captain Burnaby, hero of
the “Ride to Khiva,” and we invited him to join us
at Bar mess. He was on his way to the Lake District,
but his interest in trials made him gladly accept our
invitation, and we appointed him a sort of honorary
chaplain to the mess during the three or four days
he was with us.</p>

<p>That chance meeting saved the life of Blair’s
client. Blair made an eloquent speech in defence
of the murderer, but the medical evidence was conflicting,
and Mr. Justice Cave did not sum up for a
verdict of insanity. He left the matter to the
mercies of the jury, who could not see far beyond
the horrible fact and circumstances, and without
long consideration brought in a verdict of guilty.
Burnaby was strongly convinced that the man was
insane, and expressed his intention of moving for
a reprieve. The means of the man’s friends had
been exhausted in preparing the defence, and had
it not been for Burnaby’s energy nothing would
have been done. Burnaby started a local petition,
and later on, followed the circuit to Manchester,
where he interviewed Cave, and there he met
Hopwood. Hopwood made a most careful inquiry
<!--Page 258--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
into the facts of the case, and having satisfied
himself that it was a case for the interference of
the Home Office, assisted Burnaby with his counsel.
Under his direction the matter was carried to a
successful issue. A further examination of the
prisoner was made, and he was pronounced to be
insane, and sent to Broadmoor.</p>

<p>This was my first experience of Hopwood, and as I
grew to know him better I came to the conclusion
that not only was he a very kind-hearted and
merciful man, but he was also one of the wisest
and most sensible of judges in a criminal court that
I ever appeared before. People were very apt in
those days to look upon him as a visionary and
enthusiast, but the fact is the administrators of the
criminal law in all its harshness were the real
visionaries, for they kept their eyes straining after a
set of affairs fast passing away instead of keeping a
brave, healthy outlook on the actual facts before
them.</p>

<p>Nowadays, with our Criminal Court of Appeal and
our humaner rendering of the criminal code, it is
difficult to understand what horrible things were
done twenty-five years ago. But by no means let
us believe that the judges who did these things were
themselves cruel and harsh. It is so difficult when
you have grown up with a system to see that there
is anything fundamentally wrong in it. It seems so
dangerous to reform or to alter existing laws that
have apparently worked so well for years. I do not
think the judges who sentenced young men and
<!--Page 259--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
women to be hanged for theft, nor the later judges
who transported hundreds of small offenders to the
Antipodes, were cruel men. Certainly I know that
some of those judges who were harshest in their
sentences in the earlier eighties were kind-hearted
gentlemen in action and sentiment. They believed
in the system. They thought it was a good and
just system. It was Charles Hopwood, with his
deeper insight, who showed them they were wrong.</p>

<p>When Hopwood became Recorder of Liverpool he
was able for the first time to put his principles into
execution. The kind of thing that had been going
on all over Lancashire was instanced in one of his
charges to the grand jury after he had been a year
or two in office. “A woman,” he said, “pleaded
guilty before me of stealing some articles of little
value. I looked at the record of her history. She
had just come out after three several sentences of
penal servitude a poor, broken-down, miserable
being. Her first severe sentence anterior to the
above was one year’s imprisonment for stealing a
pound or two of butter. Her first seven years’
sentence was for stealing some trifling quantity of
butter again. Her second seven years was for
stealing some butcher’s meat. From this she had
been out a month and was again committed and
sentenced to another seven years for stealing a duck
from a poulterer’s shop. Twenty-two years for
five or ten shillings’ worth of food. It calls to mind
Hood’s passionate cry, ‘That bread should be so
dear, and flesh and blood so cheap.’ Every one of
<!--Page 260--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
these offences points to the pressure of extreme
want. I gave her a slight punishment and have
never seen her since.”</p>

<p>And that is what happened in practice. It was
found that very many of these petty criminals
pleaded guilty at Liverpool Sessions, received a light
sentence, and came out with a hope and intention,
often fulfilled, of leading honest lives. Others, of
course, fell again and again into bad ways, but
those, he argued, were really persons who wanted
some form of asylum rather than a gaol, where their
feeble will power could be protected from the
temptations of the world. These long terms of
penal servitude for petty thefts were survivals of
the old criminal code. In the middle ages a thief
was hard to catch, and probably when he was caught
the best use to put him to was to hang him. Nowadays
the thief is comparatively easy to catch, and
therefore the hanging of him when caught ceases to
be a sensible action. One of Hopwood’s arguments
was that at his sessions prisoners pleaded guilty and
gave no trouble to the prosecutor, whereas in the
days of harsh sentences prisoners pleaded not guilty
and juries hesitated to convict. Another of Hopwood’s
reasons for weighing carefully the length of a
sentence was&mdash;&#8203;as he often reminded us&mdash;&#8203;that every
year, every month, nay, every day that is added to a
prisoner’s sentence is too often a year or a month or
a day added to the misery of guiltless women and
children, whose lives and happiness depend on the
return of the wretched men whose liberty is forfeit.</p>

<p><!--Page 261--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
I have often heard Hopwood discuss these
matters, and always with profit to myself. The
mere fact that such long sentences could be defended
was, to him, evidence that the passing and witnessing
of such sentences led to a moral deterioration&mdash;&#8203;a
hardening of the moral nature of both judges and
spectators. I think this is true. We have recognised
the truth of it in relation to public executions,
and there is no doubt that to be a part of the working
machine of the criminal law blunts the edge of
compassion. Further, one effect of long sentences
on prisoners was to make them commit worse crimes
and to resist capture by violence. That is an aspect
of criminal policy that is apt to be overlooked by
those who clamour for harsher and stronger measures
against evil-doers.</p>

<p>One of Hopwood’s best attributes was that calm,
reasoning detachment of mind which enabled him to
understand the point of view of the poorer classes on
our administration of justice. What the bottom
dog sees when he puts his nose over the dock and
blinks at the learned Recorder and his brother
magistrates of the city, is a very different picture of
Justice from that which we behold so complacently
from our side of the railing. To him it seems a mere
mockery to behold Justice, well fed and prosperous,
blind to the many frauds and much misconduct of
its own class, pompously and Pharisaically denouncing
the less guilty, the mere stealing of something
to eat or something to clothe, by sentences
which should be reserved for real and atrocious
<!--Page 262--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
crime. Certainly, it makes one uneasy to remember
how many successful and fraudulent schemes have
swept away the savings of the working classes into
respectable broadcloth pockets&mdash;&#8203;even magisterial
pockets&mdash;&#8203;and the law has found no remedy and no
punishment. But the scandal is not a new one,
and is well sanctioned by precedent. Our forefathers
rhymed it, in their easy-going way:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">You prosecute the man or woman</div>
  <div class="i0">Who steals the goose from off the common,</div>
  <div class="i0">But leave the larger felon loose</div>
  <div class="i0">Who steals the common from the goose.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Hopwood was a much-abused reformer, but he
kept a stout heart, and went his way remitting
hundreds upon hundreds of years of imprisonment
in mercy to his fellow-creatures. There is no
evidence that his methods injured any class of the
community. He preached the cause of criminal
appeal to deaf ears, but since he has gone we are all
converts to his view, and wonder how we could have
hindered the reform so long. What was it that
began to awaken Lancashire folk to the belief that
Hopwood had not only a warm heart, but a clear
head, and was talking business sense? Sometimes I
think it was the statement in one of his later charges
that in not inflicting long sentences he had already
saved the taxpayer £28,000. If there is one thing
Lancashire does understand it is figures.</p>

<p>Looking back on my recollections of the men on
circuit, I think he was undoubtedly the greatest man
I knew. I say great, inasmuch as he fulfils Longfellow’s
<!--Page 263--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
words, for his life indeed reminds us of the
greater possibilities of our own humbler lives. Even
now that he has departed his footsteps re-echo
along the hopeless corridors of the gaol as of one who
brought glad tidings to the oppressed. When the
social history of the nineteenth century comes to
be written the man who, by his fearless example and
persevering energy, proved to society that the
existing treatment of the smaller criminal was
unnecessarily cruel will have a higher place than
many more ambitious reformers.</p>

<p>And in spite of his tenacity and the outspokenness
of his unpopular opinions we all loved him on
circuit, though not all of us were his disciples, and
I shall never forget the cheers of laughter and
delight that went up when an Irish colleague thus
concluded an after-dinner peroration in his honour:
“Hopwood has indade taught us what a beautiful
thing it is to temper mercy with justice.”</p>

<p>After all, like many a “bull,” it really expresses
very clearly what Hopwood was doing.</p>

<p>And though I have never more than half believed
the extravagant claims of the almost mesmeric
power of the Press over the common horde of us,
yet as a mere “man in the street”&mdash;&#8203;to use a phrase
that Greville brought from Newmarket&mdash;&#8203;I have seen
enough of the inner chambers of journalism to know
that if a journalist may not do much to educate
the public he can do something towards the education
of himself. The discussions you enter into with
men of all parties, the books you have to read, and
<!--Page 264--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
the plays you cannot stay away from, ought to
cultivate in you a better sense of charity. If it does
not, then the fault is in the seedling and not in the
soil.</p>

<p>I have never been under any delusion about the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribendi cacoethes</i>. It is not a pleasant disease, but
it has comparatively good points about it. When
the fit is upon you, you do not worry your family
and your neighbour with the details of it, as you do
when you have an attack of the spleen, or the
rheumatism, or the slice, or the pull, or whatever
recent manifestations of neuritis you may be suffering
from. You only wish, like any other well-mannered
sick mammal, to be left quietly and
undoubtedly alone till the fever leaves you. I
know I have wasted a lot of my spare time in writing;
it soothes my particular fancies, it is the form
of indolent amusement that I enjoy.</p>

<p>I daresay if I had tackled the higher things of life,
and given the industry of my overtime to more
serious pursuits, I could have reduced my golf
handicap below the mediocre twelve at which it
stands, or lost more money on horses than I have
on books. But this I can say with honesty, that
when I write <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">finis</i> on the last page, and my time is
over, the best of it has been the “overtime.”</p>

<p class="p2">When I was a small boy I liked above all things
the stories about Pharisees and Publicans. Pharisees,
I think, were connoted in my mind with schoolmasters.
Publicans, on the other hand, were a
mysterious, jovial people given to gluttony and
wine-bibbing. The latter I knew nothing about,
but the gluttony I forgave. I remember a pang of
disappointment when I discovered in older years that
Publicans were connected with the Inland Revenue.</p>

<p>In China I believe nearly all morals are imparted
by means of fables, and it is the story-telling department
of our early teaching that leaves us with
something tangible which we can use in after life
as a bobbin whereon to wind the weft of our own
thoughts. And this distinction of Pharisee and
Publican remains with me so far a reality as to
stand for something which the words themselves
of course do not mean. They are convenient symbols
for the class who want mankind to walk along the
<!--Page 266--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
path of mechanical obedience, and the class who are
out to realise the best the world can give; the class
who condemn themselves and their fellow-creatures
as miserable sinners, and the class who not only love
to be merry and wise, but are ready to sink a certain
amount of wisdom in the interests of merriment.
William Fisher, of Mauchline, was a typical Pharisee,
and Robert Burns, who immortalised him, was the
greatest of the Publicans.</p>

<p>And though I agree that there is no historical
fitness in my use of the term Publican, I think the
Pharisee is a continuing social type and probably
as eternal as the hills themselves. That is to say, it
will require some new geological period to shake him
off the earth, and he will not depart until he can no
longer be of service to the world. For my more
recent reading about the Pharisee has led me to
modify my childish imaginings. To-day I have a
great respect for the Pharisee. I have learned that
with all his faults he was a very respectable, classy
Israelite. He knew that he was set apart from the
common herd, and he was proud to be an abstainer
and ascetic, as if these things were good in themselves.
His ideal of life was to have a lot of meddling,
fussy laws of outward conduct, and not only to obey
them scrupulously himself, but to persecute others
who did not. Not an amiable character, perhaps,
but at least sincere and honest. Moreover, he knew
no better. Whether there was the same excuse for
the Pharisee of Manchester in the year of our Lord
eighteen hundred and ninety is a doubtful point.</p>

<p><!--Page 267--><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
Not that I would like to see&mdash;&#8203;or am likely to see&mdash;&#8203;a
city bereft of Pharisees. A few to sanctify and
give general tone and outward respectability are
as necessary to Manchester as lace curtains to a
suburban villa. My grumble is that in Manchester
there are too many Pharisees to the square yard.
They capture and run organisations that were made
for better things. They make it impossible for the
average wicked citizen to take part in their good
works, they bring disrepute upon the city by their
vagaries on the house-tops, and they rouse up a
great deal of hatred, malice, and uncharitableness
in fighting with great ability and vehemence against
the right of the harmless, necessary citizen to amuse
himself in his harmless, necessary way.</p>

<p>Many will remember an historic quarrel between
two old friends who were engaged in very doubtful
municipal transactions, and how they made it up
in a Wesleyan chapel, and one put £50 in the plate
as a token of regret for having uttered naughty
words about the other. By the more respectable
class of Manchester that action was regarded as
being a natural and right expression of apology. If it
was earnest and sincere it had a folk-lore resemblance,
I suppose, to the sacrifice, or burnt offering. By
the elect it was quoted as a very beautiful act of
retribution. To one like myself, outside the circle,
it was not perhaps actual evidence of conspiracy
to commit fraud, but it was at least a beacon light
warning of a dangerous shore. I remember prosecuting
an embezzler at Lancaster who always prayed
<!--Page 268--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
with his victims before he took their money. Whalley,
the famous Blackburn solicitor, who swindled his
hundreds, was a famous prayer-monger, and in all
those doubtful societies and associations which are
so popular in Lancashire, and through which the
savings of the working class are transferred to the
pockets of their elders and betters, there is generally
a halo of holiness surrounding prominent members of
the board. And as long as popular opinion is in
favour of the Pharisee, and will invest in his business
concerns because he is a Pharisee, so long Manchester,
with its simple, saving working class, is bound to
have more than her fair share of the race.</p>

<p>It has been a very interesting occupation with me
during the last twenty-five years to watch the constant
dispute between the Pharisee and the average
citizen, and though the contest is by no means over
yet, I am glad to be able to chronicle that up to
now the Pharisee is several down. And that phrase
reminds me of his attitude towards Sunday golf.
The Pharisee, of course, did not want to play golf
on Sunday, but a large majority of golfing citizens
did, therefore it was an evil thing to do, and they
must be protected against themselves. At one club
where a meeting was held and feeling ran rather
high, a humorist moved as an amendment “That
Sunday golf be not compulsory.” The leading
Pharisee&mdash;&#8203;the sect have no sense of humour&mdash;&#8203;protested
eloquently that no body of men could compel
him to play golf. The humorist drily pointed out to
him that a careful reading of the proposed rule would
<!--Page 269--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
show that they did not intend to compel him. Then,
amidst laughter and cheers, it became a rule of the
club, and, as far as I know, it is a rule to this day.</p>

<p>What an excellent, sane rule it is. Your
Pharisee is always compelling you not to do this
and not to do the other. What a calm, dignified
way of meeting him&mdash;&#8203;to place on record the common
law of the land that Sunday golf is not compulsory.
Of course, Sunday golf won all along the line, one
reason being that golf is a rich man’s amusement,
and that young Master Pharisee, when he was down
from Oxford, would have a round with his friends
on Sunday afternoon, and that made the governor’s
position peculiarly ridiculous. But wait until the
working classes demand their outdoor amusements on
the Sabbath, and you will see a gathering of the
sect worthy of Manchester in the palmiest days of
Pharisaism.</p>

<p>The fight over the Sunday papers had been fought
and won before I came to Manchester, but I remember
a little skirmish started by Canon Nunn in the
form of a protest made against the boys shouting
papers on Sunday. Now, town noises are most
people’s aversion, and if this had been a real attack
on unnecessary noise it would have been reasonable
enough. But it did not seek to stop Church bells
or boys shouting papers on Monday or Tuesday,
and was really only an effort to inconvenience
those who preferred to read the sermons of Hubert
by their own fireside rather than to listen to the
parsons in an uncomfortable church. The Sunday
<!--Page 270--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
paper is not, perhaps, the highest ideal of
journalism, but it is to many the only newspaper
of their week. It is to the discredit of the
Pharisee that he has put every obstacle in the
way of the Sunday paper to prevent it from
developing into a bigger and more useful institution
than it already is.</p>

<p>But one’s heart bleeds for the poor Pharisee
when the theatre is mentioned. I remember some
Bolton Guardians passionately endeavouring to
hinder the little workhouse children from seeing a
Christmas pantomime. One asserted that theatres
“brought ruin to thousands,” and another that
“he could not ask God’s blessing on a child whom he
took to the theatre.” Fortunately, there was a
majority of sinners among the Guardians, the holy
men were defeated and the little children were
suffered to see the pantomime.</p>

<p>One of the wildest outbursts of fanaticism that I
have ever witnessed arose over the licensing of the
Palace of Varieties. To anyone who had lived
in a healthier and more normal civilisation the
affair seemed impossible. For what was the
situation? Manchester had a few old-fashioned,
out-of-date music-halls and a very large number of
singing-halls attached to public-houses&mdash;&#8203;not the
most desirable places of entertainment. The directors
of the Palace of Varieties proposed to erect a
large modern music-hall and give the best entertainment
of that kind that could be given. It was a
London company, and, from a business point of
<!--Page 271--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
view, it made a mistake in not interesting Manchester
men in the company in a business sense. But
there was no doubt that such a hall was badly
wanted by the general body of citizens, and that the
men who were going to run the show would never
allow any performance that the average Manchester
citizen would not like to see, just as his average
London brother did. You would have thought
that any citizen of foresight would have welcomed
such a change. For years the magistrates and
rulers of the city had provided this class of entertainment
in most undesirable places, and the
complacent Pharisee passed by on the other side;
it did not come between the wind and his nobility.
But this “centre of vice,” as a prominent Pharisee
called it, was to be in the Oxford Road. It was
to be open and honest, and that was its offence. The
Pharisee knew that the Manchester citizens were
evil people, that the music-hall was going to be an
evil thing, and, therefore, certain to be popular
among evil people, and so he opposed it with a
vitality of strenuous abuse that was the admiration
of all who take pleasure in such manifestations.</p>

<p>The earnestness of the crusade was beyond dispute,
and the bed-rock principle of it seemed to be a firm
belief in original sin. The youth of Manchester,
as I gathered from letters of the protectors of
morals, is naturally evil and very prone to vice and
immorality. Once it strays from a Sunday school
into a music-hall it directly takes to excessive
drinking and other immoralities and crime. The
<!--Page 272--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
regime of the Sunday school in no way renders the
patient immune from these results.</p>

<p>In the interests of this hopeful class of youth,
said the Pharisee, the music-hall must be shut. The
fact that there are a large number of normal, healthy,
young citizens who take no harm in music-halls was
overlooked. For weeks before the licence was
applied for the correspondence rolled on. Letters
in favour of the Palace were generally unsigned, as
employees whose employers or directors were of the
ruling sect had to be cautious.</p>

<p>Nearly every church and chapel organisation went
against the improvement of music-hall performances.
I remember one notable exception. The Rev. W. S.
Caiger, rector of St. Mark’s, had the pluck to stand
up against the overwhelming torrent of holiness
that poured through the newspapers. “Mr. Price-Hughes,”
he wrote, “talked of the wickedness of
men who make a gain out of the exhibition of ballet
girls. A ballet girl who is fairly proficient in her
profession is in a far safer moral position than the
young girls I watched the other day making
flannel shirts at tenpence the dozen.” That was a
cap that would have fitted more than one leading
Pharisee, but the wearing of it might have obscured
his halo.</p>

<p>The legal history of the licence is not worth
reporting. Licensing by magistrates is not a very
exact branch of scientific law. There was the usual
canvassing and peaceful picketing by the Pharisees
and their opponents. In the first round the former
<!--Page 273--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
won, and one of their leaders called for a “great
meeting of united prayer and thanks to God for His
divine favour to our city.” I do not think this was
held. There was then a larger session. Gully
applied, Sir John Harwood was in the chair, and the
licence was gained by 33 to 27. Thus on Whit-Monday,
1891, Manchester possessed a first-rate
music-hall. Since then others have been built and
opened to the general benefit of weary citizens who
are fond of innocent amusement. And nowadays
the Pharisees sometimes patronise them, and so
“all’s well that ends well.”</p>

<p>And the whole attitude of mind of the English
Pharisee towards the inn and the tavern is the most
incomprehensible affair to the average citizen. One
would have thought that an endeavour would be
made to have the inn a place of cleanliness, beauty,
and good repute, where relaxation and bright
amusement and music might be a God-send to
hard-working people. But generations of magistrates
have decreed that the workers are to have
their drink surrounded by every discomfort. Magnificent
hotels and restaurants with music and dancing
are only for the rich. All this is, of course, done in
the great cause of temperance, and as Mr. Balfour
said, “love of temperance is the polite name for
hatred of the publican.” In the upper and middle
classes the altered manners of the day in relation to
strong drink are not due to shutting down public-houses
and degrading those that are left open.
Legislation is never likely to achieve any great moral
<!--Page 274--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
reform, nor are the licensing magistrates, as a rule,
administrators of much sweetness or great light.</p>

<p>Had they been so I think they would have noticed
that in records of English habits and English
character the inn stands for nearly as much as the
church in the social life of the people. Those of us
who have plenty of house room do not quite recognise
how an inn may be the one possible meeting-place
for friends in hours of recreation. How shortsighted,
then, to forbid its expansion, to make it
uncomfortable and degrading. In the literature of
our country the inn is very rarely spoken of with
disrespect. It were easy to quote passage after
passage, from the holiest literature to the lightest, of
the high place that the inn and what it represents
occupies in the minds of the best Englishmen.
Licensing magistrates should overhaul their Bibles
for the right references, and “when found, turn the
leaf down.” Doctor Johnson puts it in a phrase when
he says: “No, sir; there is nothing which has yet
been contrived by man by which so much happiness
is produced as by a good tavern or inn.” He then
repeated with great emotion Shenstone’s lines.
The last verse is well remembered:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">Whoe’er has travelled life’s dull round,</div>
  <div class="i2">Where’er his stages may have been,</div>
  <div class="i0">May sigh to think he still has found</div>
  <div class="i2">The warmest welcome at an inn.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The spirit of freedom and social comfort that
runs through all the English writing about inns is a
good thing to foster in itself. And in whose interest
<!--Page 275--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
is it suppressed? Not in the present-day interests of
the working man, but at the behest of the Pharisees,
who have added a commandment of their own,
“Thou shalt not permit alcohol,” and who believe
that they can by associating drink with degradation
and discomfort put an end to its use. It was
Charles Kingsley who solemnly warned the teetotalers
that they were “simply doing the devil’s
work.” As he said with much foresight and
wisdom, “I dread the spirit of teetotalism, because
it will beget that subtlest of sins, spiritual pride and
Pharisaism. Its founders, like the first founders of
every ascetism may be, and as far as I have conversed
with them are, pure, humble, and self-denying men.
So were the Fakeers, the first Mohammedan ascetics,
the first monks, the first Quakers … but after a few
generations the self-avenging Nemesis comes, the evil
spirit drops his mask and appears as Pharisaism.”</p>

<p>But if he could have lived to see the work of the
licensing benches of to-day, how they make it
daily more impossible to run an inn or tavern on
right lines, bright, respectable, large, airy, and
clean, with all reasonable recreations for its patrons,
Kingsley would have been able to give the Evil One
his due for the work of his adherents. Probably the
boldest and best solution of our difficulties would
be Free Trade, a high rateable value of premises
and reasonable police supervision. There could
not, one would think, be a better field for practising
Free Trade principles&mdash;&#8203;if you really believe in
them&mdash;&#8203;than in the trade of our national beverage.
<!--Page 276--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
It seems little less than a scandal that new licences
for experimental purposes are practically unobtainable,
and that the working classes are shut out of a fair
enjoyment of comfort and decency in tavern accommodation,
whilst the supply of luxuriously appointed
hotels and restaurants for the upper classes knows
no bounds.</p>

<p>And there is another new sin that the Pharisee
regards with peculiar horror when it manifests
itself among the working classes in any of its popular
forms&mdash;&#8203;the sin of gambling. I remember when
Bernard Vaughan preached a sermon in Manchester
to show that betting was not in itself sinful, the
whites of many Nonconformist eyes were turned
appealingly to heaven. Heaven gave no sign in the
matter, and we may take it the appeal was dismissed.
For what can be sounder than the Publican view of
this and other matters, namely, that eating, drinking
and wagering are not in themselves sinful, but that
the sin comes in with the excess. Gluttony,
drunkenness and gambling&mdash;&#8203;if we use the last word
only in its expression of excess&mdash;&#8203;those are the sins;
and even a Pharisee would not be too strict about
eating, for something like gluttony has ever been
attendant upon the profession of piety.</p>

<p>For my part, so far from forbidding children
to bet, I should teach them how to do it prettily.
A round game, say Pope Joan, played for fish&mdash;&#8203;the
engraved mother-of-pearl variety for choice&mdash;&#8203;at
which children learn to lose or win in a
sweetly mannered and unselfish way would always
<!--Page 277--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
make, I think, a charming moral lesson. I remember
my father had strong views about the importance of
everyone being taught to bet&mdash;&#8203;or gamble, if you
prefer the word&mdash;&#8203;in youth. My brother and I had
always to play whist against our parents for
farthing points&mdash;&#8203;twopence a bumper&mdash;&#8203;which had to
be paid when we lost out of our own pocket-money,
and our fellow-gamblers exacted their winnings to
the uttermost farthing.</p>

<p>My father himself admitted that this was, for us,
excessive gambling, but then there were not in those
days many serious financial calls upon our means. I
should not care to-day to risk so large a proportion
of my weekly income on the hazard of the card.
But the point is that if you learn to gamble for
definite sums at definite games you can easily
content the wagering spirit that is within you
without rushing into excess. And think how well it
would be if the schools and Universities turned out
lads capable of leading their fourth best. Surely a
man is a better citizen whose powers of observation
have been sufficiently developed to enable him to
see a call for trumps, and is not the eleven rule as
near to the business of life as the rule in Shelley’s
case? At the University a good professor of whist
might make his chair self-supporting by playing
with his pupils for very moderate points. How
few professors do that in classics, theology, or even
the sciences. The more the matter is gravely considered
the clearer it is that gambling requires
educational stimulus rather than legislative restraint.
<!--Page 278--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
It wants the Publican’s treatment rather than the
Pharisee’s.</p>

<p>What a far better world it will be for the English
workman when he is invited to play his rubber in a
neat restaurant after the manner of the Belgian who
orders his beer and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu-de-bac</i>, and rattles the dice
with noisy merriment on the marble tables. Why
should not the municipality set up a sixpenny, or, if
you will, a penny totalizer on the racecourse, and
abolish the yelling crowd of bookmakers, who by
some Pharisaical interpretation of the law are
encouraged to carry on their trade upon a racecourse
because it is not a place within the meaning of the Act?</p>

<p>What moves the Pharisee to roll in the dust and
groan about gambling is difficult to understand.
For in every business transaction in life there is an
element of gambling. When the Chancellor of the
Exchequer promotes a great scheme of health
insurance he invites his customers, in the phrase of
the ring, “to buy money,” and calls out the odds
as nine to four on the field. He knows the gambling
instinct in mankind, and very properly appeals to it.
And, indeed, the gamble is everywhere. Even in the
County Court when you pay your hearing fee there
is the uncertainty of the law, and the betting is
generally against the defendant’s solvency, and you
may never get even your original stake out of the
pool. What are the odds when the workman buys
his grocery or drapery on credit that he will get
his money’s worth?</p>

<p>I fear there is an element of jealousy in these sermons
<!--Page 279--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
against gambling. The preachers do not want the
working man to gamble with the bookmaker, but to
put his money in some insurance or investing society
with prominent Pharisees on the board, calling out
tempting odds in specious advertisements which the
Publican would be too honest to offer. And if there
is to be a statute against gambling, let us so draft it
and work it as not to kill trivial amusement, but to
warn off the course pious directors of fraudulent
companies who in prayerful tones commend their
wild-cat gambles to the working man.</p>

<p>No, the truth is that gambling is to most of us an
element of our life, and, like all the other elements,
should be used thankfully and wisely, and not in
excess. By all means follow Michael’s advice and</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="right"> … well observe &emsp;</div>
  <div class="i0">The rule of&mdash;&#8203;Not too much: by temperance taught,</div>
  <div class="i0">In what thou eat’st and drink’st;</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">and, indeed, in all actions of life. But remember that
the rule of “Not too much” can never be exercised
by a mere refusal to look the facts of life in the face
and run the risks of temptation.</p>

<p>I have preached that doctrine to many in Manchester,
but I am bound to say, without making many converts.
I remember an amusing jest played upon me at the
Llandudno Golf Club. I had been laying down the
true rule about gambling, and no doubt preaching
about it in a somewhat Pharisaical tone, when a
member of the committee asked me if I would play a
certain ex-mayor of a Midland borough who was
<!--Page 280--><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
making matches of a very gambling and extravagant
character with several of the younger visitors.</p>

<p>“He will take it from you, Judge. You tell him
firmly you are going to have a ball on and nothing
more; you can give him your views on gambling, and
don’t let him start off on the first tee with a sovereign
a hole, or anything of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I said, “I’ll keep him within
bounds.”</p>

<p>“You just talk to him like you’ve been talking to
us,” said my friend. “It will do him good. I’ll
tell him you will play him at 10.30 to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The Pharisee within me was rampant, and I
prepared to dress down the ex-mayor and make him
play his best for only half-a-crown.</p>

<p>At 10.30 he was on the tee, and I walked out to
meet him. He looked a short, thick-set, commonplace
citizen with nothing of the gambler about him.
But appearances are often deceitful. After a few
words of greeting, I thought I would get to work,
and said with some emphasis, “I will play you for
half-a-crown, sir, and not a penny more.”</p>

<p>He looked up astounded, and gasped out, “I beg
your pardon, sir.”</p>

<p>“Half-a-crown,” I repeated, and to ease his
disappointment I added, “I don’t mind a shilling on
the bye.”</p>

<p>“Sir!” he said, drawing himself up to what
height he could and speaking with scornful dignity,
“This is a very unseemly joke. I have never made
a bet in my life, and I have a poor opinion, sir, of
<!--Page 281--><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
anyone who wishes to make so fine a game as golf
the subject of betting. I am president of our Anti-Gambling
League.”</p>

<p>With that he drove off a fine drive, and I topped
the ball feebly into the rough. From the club-house
came the congratulatory laughter of many Publicans
at the discomfiture of the Pharisee.</p>

<p>It would be wrong indeed if I were to picture
Manchester as a city where the most eminent
citizens were kill-joys, and where the men wore broad
phylacteries in their buttonholes when they went on
‘Change. On the contrary, I speak of the Pharisees
as merely a small but powerful element in the
community. For in no city were there more men
of the world who loved to do good with a merry
heart and enjoy the give and take of hospitality
with their comrades and brother sinners. Manchester
men know how to work hard and play hard.
They are early risers, early closers, and early diners.
If you were a stranger wandering through the streets
after 8 o’clock in the evening, you would think
you were in a deserted city; but put your head into
the Free Trade Hall, and it will be packed for a
concert; ask for a seat in one of the popular music-halls
or a cinematograph show, and you may not
get one; you will even find people at the theatre&mdash;&#8203;quite
a throng if it is a musical comedy&mdash;&#8203;such a
varied taste has Manchester in entertainment.</p>

<p>But if you want a really delightful evening go and
dine with one of the societies or clubs whose annual
dinner is being held at one of Manchester’s best inns.
<!--Page 282--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
It may be the Statistical Society or the Playgoers
Club or the Edinburgh Academicals, but it will not
really matter. For whether it be statistics or
drama or scholarship, I can promise you both fun
and good fellowship. And I say this with honest
certainty, that there never was a more hospitable
place than Manchester, and there never were
public dinners with less dulness and boredom
about them. I don’t know that the after-dinner
speaking was any better than it is in other places,
but there was a jollity and abandon about it difficult
to convey in writing, though pleasant enough to
remember.</p>

<p>Sir John William Maclure was always a great
figure at a banquet, both literally and physically
as well as socially, and ready enough he was
either to take a jest at his own expense in good part
or to pink his adversary with an epigram. I
remember one excellent score he made off myself.
Maclure was the acknowledged impresario of the
Tory party, and was rather proud of the fact. He
used to deny with mock-modest emphasis that every
appointment of recent years was made through his
influence. “But very nearly so!” he added. It
was at a grand jury dinner, where I sat next Sir
Joseph Leese, the Recorder of Manchester, and in
proposing Sir William Maclure’s health I taunted
him with the discomfort he must feel on seeing
Leese and myself present, and knowing that we
were the only two jobs in Lancashire with which
he had had nothing to do.</p>

<p><!--Page 283--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
“Ah!” said the genial baronet as he finished his
reply, “it is correct, and it is a sad truth, no doubt
greatly regretted in Lancashire, that I had nothing
to do with the appointment of the present Recorder
or the present County Court Judge. I have the
greatest respect for those two gentlemen, but I must
correct his Honour in one particular. He referred,
no doubt in jest, to the two appointments as two
jobs. May I put him right? Sir Joseph Leese’s
appointment was not a job.”</p>

<p>In his more expansive humour, Sir John William
was quite Falstaffian in his addresses. I remember
at a dinner given by a Society of Accountants
to which he had come from London, he expatiated
on the difficulties he had had in coming down at
all. “I must tell you, gentlemen, that Mr. Balfour
said to me, ‘Sir John, it is impossible to carry on
the House if you leave us.’ ‘But, sir,’ I said,
‘I have to dine with the Manchester accountants.’
‘Ah,’ said Mr. Balfour, ‘then I won’t keep you;
but tell that excellent body from me how much I
admire them.’ (Great cheering.) But that is not
all, gentlemen. In Westminster Hall I met Lord
Salisbury, and I had the greatest difficulty to get
away from him. He wanted me to come down to
Hatfield with him. I said, ‘What, my lord, and
break my word to the Manchester accountants?’
‘No,’ said Lord Salisbury, ‘of course you mustn’t,
but I tell you what you must do; you must tell
them from me that without accountancy the nation
would be ruined.’ (More cheering.) But, gentlemen,
<!--Page 284--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
it did not end there, for at the railway station
I found there was a special train just going to
Sandringham. I was sent for, and the Prince of
Wales was gracious enough to request me to come
down and spend Sunday with him. ‘Sir,’ I said,
‘such a kind request is a command, but I have
promised to be with the Manchester accountants
to-night.’ ‘Not another word, Maclure,’ said the
Prince. ‘Keep your appointment, and tell the
Manchester accountants that in my view they are
the backbone of the nation.’” (Long and continued
cheering.)</p>

<p>Later in the evening a speaker of no particular
account, who spoke in a diffident, somewhat halting
way, said he did not move in the select circles that
Sir John William Maclure did, “but,” he continued,
“I happen to know on the highest authority the
regard in which he is held by the greatest in the
land. I was strolling in the gardens in Windsor the
other day, and a Scots servant in a kilt came up and
asked me if I came from Manchester. I said I
did. ‘And do you know Sir John William Maclure?’
‘Very well,’ I replied. ‘Come with me then,’ he
said, and he led me into a beautiful drawing-room
in the Palace, in which I found I was in the presence
of Royalty itself. After a courteous greeting I
was asked what I knew about Sir John William
Maclure. I drew a noble picture of all the virtues
and attainments which endear him to Manchester
men. When I had finished, the gracious lady said,
with a sigh of relief: ‘You have taken a great load
<!--Page 285--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
off my mind, for I was not at all sure that he was a
good companion for Albert Edward.’”</p>

<p>Fair play for Maclure, he enjoyed the chaff as
much as anyone. And that was one of the happy
traits of after-dinner in Manchester&mdash;&#8203;everyone was
there, like a schoolboy, to make fun or take fun in
good part. And, perhaps, the most admirable
feature of the whole thing was that even if there
were reporters present, they were always clever
enough to pick out the sense of the speeches, and
leave the wilder flights of humour to the pleasures
of memory.</p>

<p>Alas, John William’s jovial face smiles at us no
longer, and too many of the good fellows who were
guests at the board are shadows of memory. But
fond as I was of the older days, and loyal as I am to
the memory of the older men, I am not going to
praise yesterday at the expense of to-day. I think
the same right spirit of enjoyment still holds good,
and I hope it will always be true to say that no one
will find himself in touch with Manchester who
cannot thoroughly enter into that “joyous folly
that unbends the mind,” which is Manchester’s
habit after dinner.</p>

<p class="p2">A good history of the Manchester stage remains
to be written. Theatrically, the city has a very
noble past, and there are many signs that its future
may be equally illustrious. Probably the red-letter
day in the annals of the Manchester stage is
October 15, 1864, when Charles Calvert, with a performance
of “The Tempest,” started those ten years
of Shakespearean revivals which are now noteworthy
in the wider history of the drama of England. I
once heard a lover of art, who was also a banker,
say that Manchester had but three things to her
credit, the Rylands Library, Ford Madox Brown’s
frescoes in the Town Hall, and Charles Calvert’s
Shakespearean revivals. I told him that he did not
know the water-colours in the Whitworth Gallery
or the old-world romance of the Chetham Hospital,
and he was bound to admit, after inspection of these
securities, that he would have to increase our artistic
overdraft.</p>

<p><!--Page 287--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
The drama owes many debts to Charles Calvert.
He was the first to recognise the merit of Henry
Irving, and engaged him for the stock company
at the Theatre Royal in 1860.</p>

<p>“Why on earth did you engage that raw fellow?”
asked an influential friend of Calvert at a rehearsal.
Calvert looked at Irving, and theatrically touched
his own forehead, intimating that he considered
that Irving had brains, and that that was the reason
of the engagement. Those five years which Irving
spent in the company under Charles Calvert must
have had a deep influence in moulding his ambitions
and educating his ideals.</p>

<p>But in 1886, when I came to Manchester, the old
stock companies were gone and forgotten. The
days of the touring companies were in their prime,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</i>&mdash;&#8203;they would not like to be called
merely the “knowing ones”&mdash;&#8203;deplored in eloquent
prose the splendours of the theatrical past. Had
they aspired to verse they would have sung with
Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0a">“A jolly place,” said he, “in times of old;</div>
  <div class="i0">But something ails it now: the spot is cursed.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Yet speaking as one whose duty it was to go to
the theatre every week and write about it, I doubt
if any city had better theatrical fare than Manchester
in the later eighties.</p>

<p>For in those days, mind you, we were a humble
people. Those learned young gentlemen who can
see no theatrical merit in the leading London actors,
and will find no virtue in a play that entertains the
<!--Page 288--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
general public, had not yet left those dour Nonconformist
nurseries, where doubtless they were raised.
It was, if not a better world, certainly a merrier
world, and the poor, old-fashioned, uneducated
pagans in it actually went to the playhouse after a
hard day’s work in search of entertainment. What
is more, they got it. And being good judges of
acting, and keen about the actor’s art, there came
to meet them a never-ending procession of the best
actors from London, bringing down their own companies
in pieces that had met with success in town.</p>

<p>Turning over some playbills of 1887 it is impossible
not to realise that the theatre-goer of
that date had the opportunity of seeing a higher
and more varied standard of acting than it is possible
to witness in the Manchester of to-day. In that
one year we had Mr. Farren, that master of old
English comedy, in his three greatest studies,
Sir Peter Teazle, Sir Anthony Absolute, and Lord
Ogleby. One wishes Charles Lamb could have lived
to see Farren, and describe his Sir Peter. Lamb only
saw King, the comic, fretful, old bachelor, but left
on record his judgment that Sir Peter was to be
played as a real man, a neighbour, or old friend,
which judgment Farren put into execution. Then
Miss Mary Anderson was on tour with the most
ardent, handsome, and intelligent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune premier</i> of
our time, Forbes-Robertson. They were playing
“Pygmalion and Galatea,” “Romeo and Juliet,”
and “As You Like It.” Barry Sullivan was
still with us, and those who never saw him in
<!--Page 289--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
“Richard <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>” and “The Gamester” will not be
able nowadays to realise what was meant by the
“high and palmy” school of acting, and what were
its merits and shortcomings. Up against this interesting
memory of bygone acting was young Benson,
with his fresh, intelligent, new methods and clever
comrades, capturing the hearts and winning the
intellectual sympathy of an ever-widening circle of
play-goers.</p>

<p>In the same year, too, Wilson Barrett brought
“Claudian” and the “Silver King,” with the
company and scenery that he had with him in
London and America; Toole and Edward Terry
paid us regular visits, and Mr. and Mrs. Kendal gave
us a notable revival of “Lady Clancarty.” Sarah
Bernhardt paid Manchester a flying visit with performances
of “Adrienne” and “Theodora”; and
last, but not least, Henry Irving and Ellen Terry
rejoiced the hearts of Manchester playgoers with
what we always regarded as the festival week of
our theatrical calendar.</p>

<p>When I hear people groaning over the theatre in
the provinces of twenty-five years ago, I would
ask them to read that list of events and honestly
say whether the programme of to-day can beat it.
It may be said that there are no such stars in the
firmament to-day, and, therefore, they cannot shine
upon Manchester. But that is not wholly true.
There are great actors to-day and great productions,
but nowadays they are not brought to Manchester.</p>

<p>The main reason why that is so is probably a
<!--Page 290--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
commercial one. For some time a dead set was made
against “eminent” actors and their London productions
by mistaken friends of another type of
drama. Certain writers on the drama in Manchester
made themselves “laughing stogs to other men’s
humours,” as a Welshman may say, by exalting
the players on the eastern side of Peter Street into
a glorious company of apostles, and deliberately
tormenting the actors on the western side of the
thoroughfare as though they were a noble army of
martyrs. No doubt it injured business, and kept
some of the bigger actors away from Manchester.</p>

<p>But, in my view, the great days of touring companies
in the provinces are over. A London success
now has a bigger chance in Australia and a less certain
but, of course, more remunerative chance in America.
And although a run round some of the big towns
in England may be included in the future plans of
the more popular actors, yet I think it is quite
unlikely that Manchester will ever see so many first-rate
performances on the road as there were in 1887.
Nor is this altogether a matter of regret. I have
always been an optimist about the English theatre,
and have never believed that it would fall into the
hands of either financiers or cranks. And in
watching the evolution of the theatre in Manchester
it has been manifest for a long time that some form
of repertory theatre was on the way.</p>

<p>The beginnings were made, I think, in 1893, when
Mr. Louis Calvert produced “A Blot in the
’Scutcheon” for Mr. Charles Hughes, who, as chairman
<!--Page 291--><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
of Convocation of the University, gave a
theatrical party to his guests. He was the leading
spirit of our Independent Theatre, which produced
“Candida,” “The Master Builder,” “Love’s
Labour Lost,” and “The Two Gentlemen of Verona”
without scenery, and many other interesting plays,
in 1894. Louis Calvert was also associated with
Flanagan in the earlier Shakespearean revivals at the
Queen’s, whence he was spirited away by Sir Herbert
Tree to act in and assist him with several memorable
Shakespearean productions in London. Robert
Courtneidge, too, must not be forgotten as a
Manchester manager, who, at the Prince’s Theatre,
gave two beautiful and reverently intelligent
productions of “As You Like It” and “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” In these editions everything
was done for the text and the play, and the
actor’s art was not hampered, but the adornment,
exquisite as it was, clothed the drama without
overwhelming it with finery.</p>

<p>These were the forerunners of Miss Horniman’s
Repertory Theatre, which has won for Manchester
such renown in the world of the drama, coming as
it did at exactly the right moment, and coming&mdash;&#8203;as
surely it has come&mdash;&#8203;to stay.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who has ever indulged in
extravagant hymns of praise over any of the particular
plays and artists of the Manchester Repertory
Theatre. I think its greatest enemies have been its
“die-hard” friends, who insisted, in season and out
of season, that every actor and actress upon its
<!--Page 292--><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
stage was a genius with a consummate knowledge
of technique, and that every play produced by a
local playwright could only possibly have been
improved upon by some Belgian or Dutchman.
As I have always said, the acting is so good and many
of the plays are so interesting that they deserve to
be judged by the highest standard, and, to my mind,
the highest standard of acting and production is
to be found in the London theatres. There is no
doubt that the old stock companies had a great
advantage in coming in contact with the star actor
from time to time and playing with him. In the
modern repertory theatre this is not so. There
must necessarily be a certain touch of the amateur
in a repertory company. For myself, I recognise it,
and I like it, but I see no use in telling an amateur
that he or she has great technical skill and nothing
to learn. One does not expect to find a series of
golf champions on a local green, and we should
not expect or pretend to a series of star actors in a
repertory company.</p>

<p>When the repertory system becomes more
universal, and broadens out on the wide healthy
lines of providing entertainment for all classes of
people and giving smaller proportion of time, say
one day in seven, to the cranks and pulpiteers of
the drama, we shall find the repertory theatres
getting a greater hold on local patriotism, and one
by one growing stronger in good work and higher
ambitions, until at last they unite into what will be
in truth, as well as in name, a national theatre.</p>

<p><!--Page 293--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
There is one thing in which I heartily agree with
the expressed opinions of many well-known actors.
The Manchester audience is a great audience. Once
captured and really entertained, the Manchester
audience is a fearless and loyal friend. I have often
been delighted to read in local critical columns the
solemn excommunication of a play&mdash;&#8203;especially an
amusing play&mdash;&#8203;and to note the pompous warning to
the audience that if they are amused by this kind of
thing they condemn their mental condition, and
their moral purpose is ended; and then to go into
the theatre and hear a Manchester audience in
thorough enjoyment of what their guardian high
priest has forbidden. Only the other day I read
that “Our Boys” visited the Gaiety Theatre, and
the play “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirabile dictu</i> went amazingly.” The
Manchester digestion is good, its appetite is healthy,
and many years of theatrical diet akin to the highest
and most moving cheese has not destroyed the taste
for a slice of honest plum cake. This kind of
pedagogic critical literature is like the leader-writer’s
essay. It fills the columns of the newspaper very
decoratively. But when the polling boxes are turned
out on the table and the votes are counted, you can
appraise its value. It is the box office that speaks.</p>

<p>I am pleased to remember that on the few occasions
I have ventured on dramatic productions I
have had the Manchester audience with me.
Perhaps they carry toleration too far, but I state the
facts as they occurred. It was always certain to
my mind from the days when I ran a toy theatre and
<!--Page 294--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
cut the characters out of cardboard&mdash;&#8203;would that
some of the live actors could be cut out of their
cardboard!&mdash;&#8203;that I should some day produce a real
piece of my own in a real theatre, but I had waited
so long about it that really the ambition had nigh
gone to rest. It was Louis Calvert who aroused it
when he was staying with me at Nevin, in North
Wales, in 1900. “Why not write a play?” he
asked, and, of course, I responded too readily to the
suggestion, and no sooner was his back turned than
I was astride my hobby-horse and galloping round
the history of the world in search of a subject.</p>

<p>I reined up in the paddock of her gracious Majesty
Queen Elizabeth, where I had always felt at home
since I failed to gain a prize for her biography at the
early age of nine. I wrote a splendid play about
Queen Elizabeth. It was quite modern in its construction.
Everyone sat down and talked as long
as he or she wanted to, and went in and out without
any dramatic reason. There were very many acts,
and as many scenes to the acts as Shakespeare
himself could have supplied, and there was a lot of
real history in it lifted from Froude. It was a
valuable human document, and from the standpoint
of the elect of to-day it was a play. I doubt, however,
if in its original form it would ever have been
produced. The supply of that kind of thing seems
far larger than the demand, and my ugly duckling
got turned into a really well-behaved swan through
Louis Calvert’s collaboration.</p>

<p>“Collaboration” is a form of literary wrestling that
<!--Page 295--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
is delightful exercise, but can only be indulged in with
advantage by good-tempered friends. My partnership
with Calvert began in this way. I took the script
of my play up to London, and read it to him. I did
not read all of it, for it was a warm summer afternoon,
and he fell asleep before I was a quarter through with
it&mdash;&#8203;somewhere about Act ii., scene 7, if I remember
right. In the end he dismissed it with costs&mdash;&#8203;the
costs taking the form of breakfasting with me the next
morning at my hotel. I remember we had curried
chicken for breakfast, and I have mentally associated
curried chicken and dramatic construction ever since.</p>

<p>It was during his second helping of chicken
that Calvert suddenly announced that there was
an “idea” in my play. The words, the history,
the construction, and everything else were useless,
but the “idea” was there. At the time I thought
this estimate unduly pessimistic, now I regard it as
glowing with the warmth of friendship or curry or
both. Louis Calvert reduced the “idea” to its lowest
common denominator of four scenes. With easy
hand he unbarred the gates of light and extinguished
by the brilliancy of a few suggestions the petty historical
sequences that I had borrowed from Froude,
and within a few months out of the ashes of my old
play arose “England’s Elizabeth,” which was produced
at the Theatre Royal on Monday, April 29, 1901.</p>

<p>I remember that first night very well indeed.
There was a crowded house, and I was eager to see
how far the play was going to interest the public.
At the same time I had some doubt how far I was
<!--Page 296--><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
entitled to take a prominent part in the proceedings
as half the author of a play on its first-night production.
I felt rather like a father at a christening,
proud and happy, but ready to give the real credit of
the affair to my partner.</p>

<p>I happened to find myself in a box with my back
more or less to the stage, and I found that I could
best measure the way the piece was going, as I used
to do speeches to the jury in the old days, by fixing
on the most unpromising face in the jury and
watching it closely to see if it developed any interest
in the proceedings. I chose an old gentleman in the
third row of the stalls, who turned out to have a very
kindly nature, for he began to enjoy himself in the
first scene, and refused his wife’s entreaties to come
away and catch his train in the middle of the last act.</p>

<p>One performance among many good ones stands
out in my memory. It was that of Mr. Edmond
Gwenn as an old gardener. During the rehearsals
Mr. Gwenn, no doubt in the interests of the
piece, had uttered sentiments of his own, which
in my conceited way I thought inferior to the
words I had written. Diffidently I approached him
on the subject, and suggested that beautiful as his
words were mine had a sort of first mortgage on his
attention, as being prior in date if not in relevance.
With great charm of manner Mr. Gwenn assured me
that on the first night I should have every word as
written, and I shall never forget not only hearing
the words, such as they were, but having contributed
to the success of one of the most perfect pieces
<!--Page 297--><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
of character acting I ever witnessed. Some day
“England’s Elizabeth” will be discovered. I know
it is a good play, for many years afterwards a scene-shifter
in London asked me after it, and assured me
that he had seen “a good deal of it” when he was at
the Theatre Royal. Moreover, the lady who took
the coats and hats told me that she had seen it
several times, and always went in at the end of the
last act to cry. These testimonials are unanswerable.
Anyhow, the play is worth reviving if only for its
first gardener.</p>

<p>It was a popular success with its first-night audience,
and at the end of the play I was hurried into the wings,
and Mr. Calvert and I went forward and made our
bow. It was not a joint bow, we each made one of our
own. Calvert’s was far the best, mine was but an
indifferent affair, and then when the curtain went
down there were cries of “speech,” and Calvert
insisted that I must go on alone and say something.
I must have been very nervous, for I made a wretched
mess of it. What I really intended to say, of course,
was that all the best things in the play were Calvert’s;
but what happened was that having thanked the
audience for our kindly reception, I concluded:
“I have often been asked as to this collaboration,
which parts of the play I have written, and
which parts Mr. Calvert has written. I can tell
you in a sentence. All the parts that you have
enjoyed are mine, the rest are Calvert’s.” There
was a yell of delight. I made a really beautiful
bow this time and retired to the wings, where
<!--Page 298--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
Calvert was shaking a friendly fist at me in histrionic
anger.</p>

<p>Since then I have been in at many first nights in
which I was interested, and several of them have
been in Manchester, where, as I have already said,
I have found a kindly welcome. And although I
have no cause to complain, but rather the reverse,
of any want of kindness in any audiences to whom I
have submitted my work, I must admit that I think
the dullest first nights I have ever attended are those
of a play intended to be amusing which is produced
in London. For the house is full of guests, most of
whom are regular diners-out at meals of this kind,
with very little appetite for ordinary cake, or else
they are critics on duty. And at no time are these
latter more to be pitied than on the first night of a
farce. If they went to be amused they would cease
to be critics, and as they go to criticise they are
little likely to be amused.</p>

<p>I have been at two first nights of farces in which
I was interested. What I have seen is a strenuous
battle between the actors and a great part of the
audience, a sort of tug-of-war to see if the actors
could tug any laugh out of the weary play-goers in
front. In the two battles I witnessed, the actors won.
In the first of them a curious incident occurred.
A well-known and ample author&mdash;&#8203;let us hide the
breadth of his identity behind the letter C&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&#8203;not being to the manner born of first nights, was
so tickled at the early humours of the opening scenes
of “What the Butler Saw” that he laughed by
<!--Page 299--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
himself in his unprecedented radical way all through
the first act. His laughter was like a minute gun at
sea, exploding at intervals amidst unechoing icebergs.
There from the second row of the dress circle came
the laughter of a kind heart as the merriment of a
little child expressed in the music of a bull of Basan.
The sound of it frightened the actors horribly, and
my friend and collaborator, Frederick Mouillot,
rushed round to the stage to assure the terrified
artists that it really was laughter. For apparently it
is not etiquette to extend any sort of notice to the first
act on a first night. But later on everyone joined
in and stooped to enjoy the fun for the moment,
though C&mdash;&mdash; continued to lead by several octaves.</p>

<p>Some day in a better world I hope to write as funny
a farce, with as excellent a collaborator as Mouillot,
and to have it as well acted, and I shall play it in a big
theatre with the roof off. And there shall be no one
in front but shall have the heart of a little child and
the lungs of a giant. It will always be a dull thing
to produce a farce written for young hearts before an
audience with wrinkled livers.</p>

<p>And I think one of the most amusing judgments
ever made after one of my Manchester first nights
was delivered by an anonymous amateur critic on a
post-card, which was placed upon my desk as I
started my work in Quay Street on the morning
after the production of “The Captain of the School.”
I have received many absurd anonymous communications
in my time, for there are a great many folk
whose only taste in life seems to be to expand the
<!--Page 300--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
postal revenue in this fashion. Some of them are
crudely coarse and objectionable, but this post-card
breathed a genuine sincerity and honesty of dispraise
that was admirable. It ran:</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">A Voter.</span></p>

<p class="small">Sir,&mdash;&#8203;I went last night to see your play. It was like your
verdicts&mdash;&#8203;Rotten!</p>

<p>Rough on the playwright, of course, but does it not
contain a subtle compliment to the Judge? I
extend to my anonymous correspondent my best
thanks. No post-card that I have ever carried about
in my pocket has given greater pleasure to my
friends.</p>

<p>That first night of “The Captain of the School,”
on November 14, 1910, had a keen interest for me,
inasmuch as it was the first appearance of my
daughter, Miss Dorothy Parry, so that, as it were,
from a domestic point of view we were having two
first nights at the same time. She made an excellent
success, which she repeated in London and elsewhere;
but certainly she ought to agree with my appreciation
of the Manchester audience. May it be my good
fortune to risk another argosy among its friendly
waves before the end of the last act.</p>

<p class="p2">At the corner of Byrom Street and Quay Street was
the Manchester County Court, as I knew it, from
1887 to 1894, as a barrister and afterwards from that
date to 1911 as judge. I must have spent a great
portion of my waking hours within its dreary walls.
Often do I walk down Peter Street in my dreams, and
find the same officer on point duty holding up the
traffic like the waves of the Red Sea in order that I
may cross Deansgate with dignity and he may
deliver an elaborate salute; but following the
pleasant desultory fashion of dreamland I never
actually reach the old Court, but wander away elsewhere.
I do not think when I am departed I shall
ever return to haunt the court-house, not merely
because it is noisy, ill-ventilated, and uncomfortable&mdash;&#8203;most
court-houses are&mdash;&#8203;but because if I once got
back there I should want to be at work again, and to
take a hand in what was going on, for despite all the
dreariness of its somewhat squalid routine, I found
a percentage of entertainment in the day’s work.
<!--Page 302--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
I think the real reason spirits do not return to their
old haunts is that they know that they would not be
allowed to cut in and take part in the game.</p>

<p>I was on the point of saying I had no unpleasant
memories of Quay Street, but that would scarcely
be correct, for it was in that court that I had the
misfortune to be shot. One does not care to
remember the tragedies of life, but if one is to set
down the happenings of one’s Manchester days one
can hardly leave out such an extraordinary occurrence.
The facts as I understood them were these.
On the morning of July 26, 1898, I had to cancel
the certificate of a man named William Taylor. The
case had lasted very late the night before. After
the decision and just as the next case was started I
became aware of what I first thought was a dynamite
explosion close to my left ear. The second explosion,
which caused me intense pain, I recognised to be a
pistol shot, and the bullet from that I carry about
with me still. The third, which gave me even greater
pain, never hit me at all, for Henry Thomason, with
magnificent bravery, had caught my assailant by
the throat, thrown him on to the floor, and the third
shot, in fact, went into the plaster on the opposite
wall and then out again into the middle of the court.
I must have tried to drag my head out of the way
and so hurt myself. I never absolutely lost consciousness,
and remember Montgomery, the surgeon
who happened to be in court, examining my throat
and saying “there was no perforation.” I hadn’t
an idea what he meant, but it sounded reassuring.</p>

<p><!--Page 303--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
There is no object in recalling the long months of
pain that I had to go through before I was fit to work.
It is pleasanter to remember the enormous kindness
shown to me by all sorts and conditions of people
during those grievous days. In the nursing home
they very soon made an effort to photograph the
bullet with the X-rays, which were then only
beginning to be used. It was a terrible ordeal in
those days, and I should think I was over twenty
minutes trying to lie still on a couch with a square
negative for a pillow whilst the light spluttered
about in a most unpleasant way. When it was
developed they showed me a blur with one indistinct
blob on it.</p>

<p>“What is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The bullet,” said the doctors.</p>

<p>“And have you photographed all the metal in
my head?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then where is the portrait of my gold tooth?”</p>

<p>I never got an answer to that, and the doctors
took away the photograph, which I always maintained
was only of interest to dentists.</p>

<p>A year ago I thought I would make a further investigation
and went down to Birmingham, where my
friend, Dr. Franklin Emrys Jones, with his partner,
Dr. Hall Edwards, made several radiograms of it.
Dr. Hall Edwards was in South Africa during the
war, and was specially interested in bullets. It is
marvellous, after all he has suffered in the pursuit
of radiography, to see him, maimed and in pain,
<!--Page 304--><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
directing the work with the greatest enthusiasm.
The modern engines are more terrifying to the victim,
and the affair is somewhat uncanny, for when the
light is turned on the operators retire behind a lead-glass
screen and watch you from afar. But it was
all over in a few minutes, and very soon they
returned with a negative in a dish, not a flattering
likeness, perhaps, but an excellent picture of a side
view of my skull and the bullet at the base of it.</p>

<p>I had plenty of doctors to look after me, and they
were kindness itself, Wright and Southam and
Judson Bury were with me at Quay Street, and Dr.
Larmuth came up and put my ear-drum back in its
place. It had got blown aside by the concussion
of the revolver. I think that depressed me more
than anything, for I knew if I was deaf I should never
get back to work again. It was the left ear, and one
of my early visitors said to cheer me up, “That
doesn’t matter, judge, that’s the defendant’s ear,
and you never listen to him, you know.” “That
may be,” I said, “but there is all the difference
between not listening and not hearing when you do
listen.”</p>

<p>After some weeks I got down to Nevin, in North
Wales, but it was extraordinary what a long time
it was before I got over the shock. Of course, for
many months I was often in pain, but with every
desire and incitement to get back to ordinary life
I found I had not, at first, the will to do it. I
remember Dr. Leech, who was making a tour of that
part of Wales to write an essay on its climatology,
<!--Page 305--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
came up to see me, and was insistent in his kindly
way upon my having a swim. I had had to grow
a beard, and I looked like an Anarchist, and I hated
going about, because people stared at me. However,
the next day I crawled down to the shore with
Dr. Leech, and with the aid of two sticks walked into
the sea. I regarded the doctor as a manslaughterer
at the time, but when I came out rejoicing and
walking ever so much better I knew I had won the
first victory. The second was over my bicycle,
which I knew I couldn’t possibly ride, and very
nearly didn’t in consequence. After that I got
bold and went swimming out a bit until a six-inch
wave knocked me on the side of the head, and
reminded me that I was very far from being whole.</p>

<p>I recall these things because I have often found them
useful to refer to in those difficult cases of neurasthenia
and malingering in workmen’s compensation
cases. Here was I, with every incentive to recovery
and every desire to recover, and every opportunity
that human being could have, bungling the affair
from want of the necessary will power. I learned
that after a severe shock it is a really tough job for
an honest man to get himself back into condition,
and that long after wounds and limbs are healed or
mended there remains a real mental indisposition to
look the world in the face again that is hard to overcome.
Even to-day, though all the effects of the
accident have practically passed away, I cannot sit
still if anyone suddenly opens a soda-water bottle
at the back of me, and I am distinctly gun-shy.</p>

<p><!--Page 306--><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
I got back to work in November. It was too early,
and I broke down again, but I did get back to work
and was able to do it. I could not have stood a
formal greeting, but a great many friends came down,
and there was quite a crowded court as I took my
seat. I had arranged with Charley McKeand that
as soon as I took my seat he should jump up and ask
for some imaginary case to be adjourned to prevent
anyone starting an oration. This was done. A
few days afterwards Joseph Collier, the surgeon, told
me an amusing anecdote about it. “I was coming
down Byrom Street,” he said, “and the officer at
the door, whom I know, called out to me, ‘Hi,
Mr. Collier, you’d better coom into coort this morning.
There’s gran’ doin’s on. Judge Parry’s taking
his seat again, and Charley McKeand’s down, an’
’e’ll be makin’ a fine pow-wow. You see.’ So I
went in,” continued Collier, “and as you know,
nothing happened. When I came out I jeered at
the policeman, who seemed quite upset. ‘I never
saw the like of it,’ he said. ‘After all that’s ’appened,
and ’im so well liked and aw, and they make no more
fuss than if he’d just been off the bench to have a
drink like usual.’”</p>

<p>I think the officer referred to the luncheon
interval. There were certainly no other adjournments,
even on the thirstiest days, though Collier
often used to chaff me about it. However, I soon
had a good story against Collier. There had been
an accident to a workman, which was said to have
resulted in concussion of the spine. The workman
<!--Page 307--><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
was a very stolid character, and Collier had examined
him for the insurance company. The following
cross-examination took place:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Do you remember Mr. Collier examining you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do.”</p>

<p>“Did he stick a pin into your thigh?”</p>

<p>“Aye, ’e did an aw.”</p>

<p>“Did you start up and scream?”</p>

<p>“Well, so would you.”</p>

<p>“But hadn’t you told him your thigh was numb
and had no feeling?”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of telling ’im onything?” said
the witness, pointing contemptuously at Collier.
“That’s where doctor made ’is mistake. I told ’im
I were numb i’ front, and what does ’e do but go
and stick a pin into my backside. ’E’s no doctor.”</p>

<p>When the case went to the medical referee
Collier’s views were upheld, though I always used
to warn him against the danger of sticking pins
into the wrong part of the human joint.</p>

<p>I could fill many columns with pleasant memories
of our works and days at Quay Street. The Registrar
and his clerks and the high bailiff and myself
were a very happy family, and despite our somewhat
gloomy surroundings we managed to put a good deal
of cheeriness and heartiness into our work. It is not
for me to say how far we succeeded, but this I may
say for the Court, and I chronicle it with pride, that
I believe it was the only Court in England that had
a cricket team with a card of fixtures, and regularly
played a high bailiff and a judge.</p>

<p><!--Page 308--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
And, on the whole, I think the staff, from lowest to
highest, worked hard to make an efficient machine of
it and certainly the affairs of the poorer people were
thoughtfully administered, and the Registrar and
chief clerks did a lot of work in looking after the
estates of the widows and orphans in cases under the
Workmen’s Compensation Act. Personally I used
to see each of the widows once a year at least, and by
keeping in touch with the family doings we were
often able to give a child an appropriate start in life
which he or she would never have had if the money
had merely been invested and automatically paid
over. Not every experiment was a success, of
course, but the experience satisfied me that the death
payments at least were a very great boon to the
working class, enabling a widow to save her home and
the home life for her children in a way she could not
have done before the passing of the Act.</p>

<p>No one dislikes grandmotherly interference more
than Manchester folk, unless it be Salford folk, but in
dealing with large and unaccustomed sums of money
it is a good thing that the widows and orphans should
have the co-operation of the Court. Naturally many
of these poor widows have short views, and cannot see
far enough ahead to the days when what to them is
indeed a bottomless purse shall be found to be empty.
It is very difficult to prevent them rushing into
businesses for which they are ill-fitted. They are
surrounded by agents and friends, who have some
unsuccessful business&mdash;&#8203;generally a fried-fish shop&mdash;&#8203;to
sell at a high price, and both buyer and seller are
<!--Page 309--><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
indignant with the hard-hearted and unbelieving
judge when he wants to see books and invoices, and
to have proof of the weekly takings before he will
allow the widow to invest her money. To the
widowed soul, fried fish is synonymous with fortune;
to me it always smells of fraud.</p>

<p>I cannot say that all our battles with ignorance and
shiftlessness were victories. We got badly hit on
occasion. I remember in my early days a young
widow, who had re-married, coming with her husband,
a handsome young fellow, with letters from relations
from America, and a scheme of going out there,
where work was plentiful. It seemed an excellent
plan, and after some discussion all the figures having
been put before us by the young man in a businesslike
manner, a big sum was handed out for the
equipment and travelling expenses of the family, and
the remainder was to be sent over when they arrived.
Months passed and we heard no more of them, and at
length one day the clerk told me the woman had
turned up in the office, with a black eye and a new
baby. They had not been nearer to America than
Blackpool, and the man had never done a stroke of
work until the money was spent. That was one of
our failures. Since then we have worked through
an emigration society or taken the tickets ourselves.
It has been notable that on several occasions when
I have told the applicants that we would take their
tickets and make all the arrangements they strongly
persuaded me not to go to the trouble, and seemed
quite pained that they should be the cause of so
<!--Page 310--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
much extra worry. Indeed, finding me adamant on
the subject, they have thrown up the idea of emigrating
altogether and stayed in the old country.</p>

<p>Tombstones are the source of a great deal of
difficulty. Seeing the example set in high places, one
sympathises with the poor in their desire to show
respect to their dead, even if one is convinced that
the measures they take are unwise. I generally like
to postpone the drawing out of money for a tombstone
as long as possible; but I have never made any hard-and-fast
rule that nothing shall be used for such a
purpose. I remember one widow grieved very much
that I could not allow her a considerable sum for a
“stone.” I told her we would discuss it again in
about twelve months. When she returned after
this period I happened to remember her trouble,
and said: “I do hope, Mrs. X., you have thought
over all I said to you last time about the tombstone.”</p>

<p>She looked down on the ground, and I feared we
were going to have tears.</p>

<p>“I think there are so many better ways of showing
respect,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she began falteringly, “so do I, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad,” I said heartily.</p>

<p>“So am I,” she said, blushing. “You see, I’m
going to be married again.”</p>

<p>And though one laughs over the little comedies
in the lives of these poor folk, I became daily
more and more impressed with the sterling worth
of the people whose servant I was, and I spoke
<!--Page 311--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
with all sincerity when I said, on leaving Manchester,
that I took off my hat to the Lancashire man who
brings up his wife and children worthily on twenty-five
shillings a week. I have been face to face with
the man, and feel that his outlook on life is a great
asset for our country, and that it has been a privilege
to be called upon to minister to his needs, even in the
obscure atmosphere of an urban County Court.</p>

<p>As a witness, he is a most refreshing and epigrammatic
personality. He is far from being a saint or a
hero, but he is in the main honest, homely, and
humorous, and you can learn a great deal of the difficulties
of his works and days by appreciative study of
his sayings. Most of them could have left the court
with a clear conscience, saying in the old style:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Here, for instance, is a melancholy epigram on
Manchester as a city, where sane human pleasure
should be catered for by the rulers and governors.
It occurred in the cross-examination of a workman by
that excellent advocate, Mr. Hockin. He was seeking
to show that the witness was not present at the works
when an accident to which he was testifying had
happened.</p>

<p>“But I think that you said you had a holiday that
day.”</p>

<p>“I had an aw!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell the Court,” asked Hockin,
<!--Page 312--><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
in his most archdeacon-like manner, “that you came
back to the works when you might have been
enjoying a holiday?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the witness.</p>

<p>“Why did you do that?” asked Hockin, with a
touch of triumph in his voice as if there was no
possible explanation.</p>

<p>The reply was only too obviously truthful.</p>

<p>“What should I do? I have nowhere to go. I’m
teetotal now.”</p>

<p>It requires quite a long and subtle study of the
Lancashire witness to really understand when he is
condescending to incivility, though many of his
phrases might too hastily be interpreted against his
sense of good manners. An excellent old brewery
collector was trying to recover a lost barrel, and was
quite unable to show me documentary evidence of
its residence in the defendant’s house. I was
cross-examining him about it, and could get no
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“When was the beer sold?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Was it several years ago?”</p>

<p>“Nay, but I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But I must know the date,” I replied sternly.</p>

<p>He folded his hands in despair at my unreasonable
obstinacy and sighed deeply, and speaking with
slow emphasis said: “Then all I can say is that
you’ll have to go down to the brewery.”</p>

<p>I shall not easily forget the entire change of scene
caused in a small County Court drama by a very
<!--Page 313--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
Lancashire witness. The plaintiff was a south-country
Chemist’s assistant, most dapper and polite&mdash;&#8203;a
very Osric of the pharmaceutical world. His
employer had dismissed him for drunkenness. On
the view it was hard to believe that the plaintiff
had vigour enough for any such delinquency, but
his testimony, given in a mincing voice, was a little
suspicious.</p>

<p>“I assure you, sir, that I have the misfortune to
suffer from asthma, and my doctor has ordered me
to take whisky on these foggy mornings, that are
so severe in this climate. I am a very temperate
man. I need hardly say, sir, a very temperate
man. A lady came in for a syphon, and I gave her
one. She thought it was soda, and it was lemonade.
It was entirely the lady’s error, and that seems to
have annoyed the lady. It does annoy ladies, and
she seems to have got the impression&mdash;&#8203;of course,
an entirely mistaken impression&mdash;&#8203;that I was not,
in fact&mdash;&#8203;sober. Your Honour will know what I
mean; but, of course, a mistake, a sad mistake,
and the lady unfortunately sent word to my master,
and he came down and was very violent, and threw
me out of the shop.”</p>

<p>The defendant said the man was drunk, and proceeded
to call witnesses. The lady was ineffective,
but a working man called on subpœna and a very
unwilling witness put the matter beyond doubt.
We had no advocates, so I told him to tell his
story in his own words.</p>

<p>“I dunno reely much aboot it,” he said, “I wor
<!--Page 314--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
passing shop an’ ’ad a bit o’ cough mysen, so I went
in for twopennoths o’ balsam. An’ when I got in
t’ shop I saw yon mon”&mdash;&#8203;pointing to plaintiff&mdash;“leaning
up agin them variagated decorated drawers
like they ’ave in them shops, an’ I says to mysen,
I says, ‘’Enery, you ain’t tired o’ your life yet, are
you, ’Enery?’ An’ with that I cooms out wi’out
ony balsam&mdash;&#8203;an’ that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>The plaintiff, who had little dramatic instinct,
insisted on cross-examining as to whether the
witness was prepared to swear he was drunk, but the
witness replied with true Lancashire charity and
caution, “I ’oped as ’ow you was drunk, but, in
coorse, you might ’a’ been taking poison.”</p>

<p>A very few months after I was made judge I got
a homely rebuke from a suitor that led to an interesting
reform in my conduct of affairs. A man was
telling me in moving for a new trial that he had got in
the County Court on the day of the trial too late for
the hearing. I asked him why he had not waited until
the end of the day and made an application to me.</p>

<p>“So I did,” he said, “but as soon as last case was
over you jumped up and bolted through yon door
like a rabbit.”</p>

<p>After that I made more dignified exits, and I also
arranged a practice of waiting and talking to everyone
who was left over and had anything to ask, so I am
grateful to my critic. I used to have many strange
applications for advice, some quite beyond my power
of satisfying. For instance, a working man came to
me once with the most perplexing problem. “I
<!--Page 315--><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
want to know,” he asked, “whether I must call
my little girl Ferleatta?” I spell it phonetically,
as he could not help me in the spelling, but I fancy
the real name may have been Violetta.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Two young women as visited the missis during
’er confinement coom one neet as we were at tea.
They takes the baby down to parish church and they
brings it back ‘Ferleatta,’ an’ I wants to know what
are my rights.”</p>

<p>I counselled consultations of a kindly nature
with the young ladies, foreseeing litigation of a
complicated and painful ecclesiastical nature.</p>

<p>Another poor fellow told me his adventures when I
was sitting as Recorder in the Minshull Street Courts,
and he was summoned as a witness. “First I went
down to the County Court an’ they tells me to coom
up here, an’ I gets into the Police Court and an officer
tells me to cross the bridge, an’ I lost my way an’
got into the Coroner’s Court, and they sent me out
o’ that and unfortunately I got among the solicitors,
and they told me to go into the hall and wait till
my name wor called&mdash;&#8203;which it never wor called.”</p>

<p>I forgave him all the trouble he had caused for
sake of the word “unfortunately.”</p>

<p>I am very sorry for a man who gets to the wrong
court; the summons is generally clear enough for the
ordinary citizen, but to the less literate of the
community it seems often a difficult problem.</p>

<p>If one had the faculty of painting genre pictures of
“Our Street” in Hulme or Ancoats the County
<!--Page 316--><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
Court is the place to find the incidents. A good lady,
a little, short, fussy woman, was describing to me
how she got a plumber’s job done in her house. I
could see the picture.</p>

<p>“Landlord tells me ’e couldn’t get Thomas to do
it, ‘and,’ says ’e, ‘if you can I give you luck.’ I
went to Thomas’s missus, an’ I says, ‘Where is ’e?’
She says to me, ‘If you don’t find ’im in the beer’ouse
you won’t find ’im at all.’ With that I went
to the beer’ouse an’ I got ’im out, and I takes ’im
up to the ’ouse. ’E wasn’t for coming, but I
sauced ’im all the way down Pimblott Street, an’
’e kept telling me whot ’e’d do if I was ’is wife.”</p>

<p>Here is another recollection of a graphic story
told by a woman witness. If unreliable at times, the
evidence of women is generally full of good advocacy.
This good wife gave me a very dramatic account
of her husband’s dealing with a Jew jeweller. The
tallyman tempts women with drapery and men
with jewellery. The wife turned up to defend the case,
very wisely leaving her husband at home. The
tallyman produced an order form with a cross on it
alleged to be made by the absent husband. I asked
the woman if her husband was a scholar. “No,”
she said, “David wasn’t brought up to scholarship;
he was brought up to hard work.” Then she told her
story. “Yon man,” she said, pointing to the plaintiff,
“his name is Isaacs, and he’s by way of being a
Scotchman, and I’ve had a shawl off him. Many
a time he’s tried to sell David a watch, and I told
him I wouldn’t have it. Well, he comes in Saturday
<!--Page 317--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
afternoon for a talk with a box of joollery. I
remember the day ’cause he tripped over our
door-mat and nearly spilt hisself, and he says to me,
‘I’ll have to be selling you a new door-mat, missus,’
and I says to him, ‘Our door-mat’s plenty good
enough for the folks that comes across it.’ With that
he laughed and gave me a shilling to get a quart at
M‘Ginnis’s vaults, and when I comes back they was
handling the joollery, and knowing how soft my
husband is about joollery I made him put it back in
the box afore I gave him the beer, and I can swear
there was no watch there then. We all talked a bit
and supped the ale, and then he and David went
out. It was very late when David came home, and
he came home drunk with a cigar in his mouth, but
he never had no watch on him ’cause I put him to
bed myself.”</p>

<p>The case was adjourned for David to appear, but I
never saw David, and I dare say the affair was amicably
settled over another quart from M‘Ginnis’s vaults.</p>

<p>Some of the most amusing evidence is given in
running-down cases. No Lancashire witness ever
admitted that he did not understand a plan, but it
is generally waste of time to trouble him with one.
Counsel, however, will do it, and I was delighted once
when counsel’s own witness marked with a cross
the scene of a collision between a tramcar and a milk
float in the chancel of the parish church.</p>

<p>They are very dogmatic, too, about the miles
per hour a vehicle is travelling, a fact that few
can measure accurately. The following dialogue
<!--Page 318--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
between counsel and witness shows how worried and
confused a witness may get about comparative pace,
but his attempted recovery from the dilemma is at
least ingenious.</p>

<p>“Where were you, and what were you doing?”
asked counsel.</p>

<p>“I was walking along the Eccles Road towards
Eccles at about four miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“What pace was the trap going?”</p>

<p>“Very slow indeed,” replied witness. “Say
about three miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried counsel, triumphantly; “but the
trap overtook and passed you&mdash;&#8203;you forget that.”</p>

<p>“I do not forget. It’s you that forget,” replied
the witness with indignant assurance. “The trap
was trotting; I was walking.”</p>

<p>And it is because the bulk of the people who come
before the Court are so bewildered by the forms
and ceremonies of litigation, and so rarely do themselves
justice in the examination and cross-examinations
as at present conducted, that I want to see
all this replaced for small affairs by some simpler
and more domestic procedure. We should lose
some of the comedy, no doubt, if we had our Courts
of Conciliation and the judge were to try to make
peace instead of giving a legal verdict in matters
where there is very little right and plenty of wrong
on both sides, but we should gain greatly in utility.
And if anyone is in doubt whether there is room for
such a court, let him go down to Quay Street for
himself and verify these quotations.</p>

</div><!--end container-->

<p class="p2">There are some who think that in Manchester
the Caucasian is very much played out, but I am
not of their number. I look back on the past
history of the city and compare it with the present,
and am still of opinion with Richard Cobden that
Manchester is the place for all men of bargain and
business. The gambling trade in bills no doubt
belongs to London, but the real trade of making,
collecting, and selling belongs to Manchester. For
Manchester is the place where people do things.</p>

<p>It is good to talk about doing things, but better
still to do them. As a great teacher used to say
to his art students: “Don’t talk about what you are
going to do&mdash;&#8203;do it.” That is the Manchester habit.
And in the past through the manifestation of this
quality the word Manchester became a synonym
<!--Page 320--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
for energy and freedom, and the right to do and to
think without shackles.</p>

<p>And as I say, there are some who think that the
days of freedom and energy are gone, and that
Manchester is “left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a
lodge in a garden of cucumbers,” but I refuse to be
of their party. For as I have read of the past, so I
look round and see here to-day the old eternal fight
going on, the contest between those who think anything
is good enough for Manchester and those who
think nothing is too good for Manchester. For
these contending spirits are the Genii fighting over
the soul and the body of the Master of the Event.</p>

<p>And anon you find the good spirit in the ascendant,
and a citizen raises an Owens College or a Whitworth
Gallery or a Rylands Library that the name of
Manchester may be magnified, and again the Evil
Genie has gained the day and hardened the hearts of
the rulers of the city, and they can only sit and talk
and talk about necessary libraries and art galleries,
having altogether lost the Manchester habit of doing
them. And to those who are in despair about the
hopelessness of the fight, let me recall that delightful
American parable dear to my childhood, the Story
of the two Frogs. There were, as I remember, two
frogs who visited a dairy. One was an optimist and
the other a pessimist. And the latter fell into a
milk-can and swam about, gazing despondently at
the shiny sides up which he could not crawl, and at
last feebly ceased to struggle and sank to the bottom
and was drowned. Now the optimist frog also fell
<!--Page 321--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
into a milk-can, and he too looked up at the shiny
sides of the can, but he kept a good heart, and all
through the night swam and kicked and struggled,
until in the early dawn he found himself at the
bottom of the can sitting on a pat of butter.</p>

<p>That kind of spirit is not only to be found in
frogdom. Richard Cobden had it, and calls it
Bonapartian, “a feeling that spurs me on with the
conviction that all the obstacles to fortune with which
I am impeded will (nay <em>shall</em>) yield if assailed with
energy.” That is the true Manchester spirit, and it
is not dead to-day.</p>

<p>And to my thinking, if you want to realise fully
the wonderments that trade and commerce could
produce if they would, turn into the real Manchester
Cathedral&mdash;&#8203;not the parish church which belongs to
the past&mdash;&#8203;but the Cathedral of to-day in Deansgate,
the Rylands Library. Around you, seated in their
stalls, are the great prophets and preachers of the
world, clothed in glorious but perfectly legal vestments,
not thrusting their messages uncivilly toward
you, but waiting in dumb dignity until you feel
worthy to approach and learn. And for my own
part to reach one of those side niches, those pleasant
pastures of study, harbours of letters in quiet creeks
away from the main stream of the library, is to
arrive at the haven where I would be. I do not
grudge another his ritual and his music, and the
sing-song of his priest. I only know that I feel
better without them. For in this building I find an
odour of sanctity not always to be found in churches.
<!--Page 322--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
Here I have listened to sermons&mdash;&#8203;voices from beyond&mdash;&#8203;more
eloquent in their wisdom than many preached
in latter-day pulpits. Sitting in peace and at rest
in this beautiful building, the dim ripple of the
outer traffic just reaching my ear, I have often
wondered whether all Manchester might not be
builded and furnished in the same spirit of honour
and worthiness. And being faintly imbued with the
Manchester spirit myself, there are times when I
believe that this will really be so. For my eyes
refuse to see, even in nightmares, a picture of
Manchester in ruins, with tourists tracking over the
desert on hired camels to visit the remains of the
Town Hall with its battered frescoes, and the shell of
the Rylands Library, sole relics of a vanished city.</p>

<p>My dreams and imagery are far otherwise, and I
hold with the poet that eidolons are the entities of
entities. And if I have ever appeared to the good
librarians in Deansgate to have had my eyes closed
in ecclesiastical slumber, it was not really so. I was
seeing visions, dreaming dreams, or more truly perhaps,
I had impelled my spirit into the future and
had left my body, umbrella-wise, hypothecated in
the safe keeping of the library officials. For in this
method I have many times visited Manchester several
hundred years hence, and my difficulty has always
been to find the Rylands Library, or even the Town
Hall, so many noble buildings of even finer proportions
stood among the lawns and gardens and
fountains of the city. And I had rather see visions
of a New Manchester than a New Jerusalem.</p>

I know no prettier dream, if it be one, than to sail
from Eastham up the pure waters of a wider canal
and see the country folk resting after their day’s work
in the dainty cabarets along the shores, and as the
last lock gates close behind you and you swing into
the great lagoon to the south of the city, the setting
sun crimsons the clean stone and marble warehouses
of a noble city. For this I can prophesy&mdash;&#8203;it is
information, not a tip&mdash;&#8203;that if there is to be a
Manchester at all some hundreds of years hence it
will be a city without smoke, its people will be
healthy and handsome, its Pharisees will be fewer,
and all will breathe pure air and walk clean streets,
and when a citizen’s day’s work is done he will be
found angling for a trout in the church pool with a
better chance of success than he would have to-day.</p>

<p>But these futures depend on the good Genie of
Manchester winning the battles of to-day. For
when energy, freedom, and the power to do things
depart from Manchester she will become “as an oak
whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no
water.”</p>

<p class="center small">SOME PRESS OPINIONS.</p>
<div class="small">
<p><cite>Athenæum.</cite>&mdash;“They deal among other topics with the letters of
Dorothy Osborne, the disadvantage of education, the craftsmanship of
the drama and the nice problems of the kitchen; and they all possess a
lightness of touch and sense of companionableness which makes them
agreeable reading.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">G. K. Chesterton</span> in <cite>Illustrated London News</cite>.&mdash;“I cannot refrain
from imploring my readers to get hold of Judge Parry’s ‘Judgments in
Vacation,’ it is extraordinarily good.”</p>

<p><cite>Morning Leader.</cite>&mdash;“Literature and law jostle each other with a
delightful air of indifference.”</p>

<p><cite>The Standard.</cite>&mdash;“It is a rollicking book.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Graphic.</cite>&mdash;“A wide range of knowledge and experience and a
faculty of literary skill unite to make this collection of his papers
exceedingly readable.”</p>

<p><cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite>&mdash;“It is all very jolly and irresponsible.”</p>

<p><cite>Eye-witness.</cite>&mdash;“But it is not only a witty, sparkling book, it is a human
document in which the tragedy of the poor, their never-ending debts,
their hopeless yet patient insolvency is sketched with a profound insight,
a living sympathy.”</p>

<p><cite>Westminster Gazette.</cite>&mdash;“But perhaps we have said enough to show
that for an hour or two by the fire the book is all good company.”</p>

<p><cite>Liverpool Daily Post and Mercury.</cite>&mdash;“The essays and papers in his
Honour’s book are in every way worthy of the bright humour, vivacity
and literary skill we are wont to associate with the name of the Admirable
Crichton of the County Court Bench.”</p>

<p><cite>The Spectator.</cite>&mdash;“Judge Parry deals with various subjects, social,
literary and other, and has something worth hearing to say about all of
them.”</p>

<p><cite>Daily Telegraph.</cite>&mdash;“Whether his themes are grave or gay the mood in
which he treats them, lively or severe, Judge Parry is invariably
interesting, and his volume should be widely read.”</p>

<p><cite>Morning Post.</cite>&mdash;“For to pay the last and best compliment, clubability
of style is a thing as pleasant as it is rare.”</p>

<p><cite>Yorkshire Post.</cite>&mdash;“But humour is by no means the only rare quality
in these ‘Judgments.’ In the pure Lamb and Stevenson sense they are
literature.”</p>

<p><cite>Evening Standard and St. James’s.</cite>&mdash;“It goes without saying that this
collection of essays is witty, full of amusing anecdotes, and besides that,
is written with the literary sense which always dignifies the work of his
Honour.”</p>

<p><cite>Law Magazine.</cite>&mdash;“All the essays are worth reading, but the most
important are connected with the County Court.”</p>

<p><cite>Boston Evening Transcript.</cite>&mdash;“His latest book is as witty and wise as
any of its predecessors, and may be heartily commended without any
reserve to all who enjoy an essayist of the Lamb School.”

<cite>New York Herald.</cite>&mdash;“The definite qualities of jurisprudence have not
so often found so agreeable an exponent as the author of these graceful,
good natured essays.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

<h2 class="pgx" title="">START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
